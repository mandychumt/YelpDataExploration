The atmosphere is colorful cheery & bright which is nice .\nThere was previously, another Mexican restaurant in this same space - Taco Loco which didn't last more than a couple years here for whatever reason .  It was a steel mill worker bar, eons ago .\nI recommend the Chorizo-Cheese fries as an appetizer .  Cheese & Chorizo were meant for each other !!!\nI think the prices are on the high side for a burrito and etc but i'm sure their rent is very high considering it's on the more high-price end of Carson Street .\nI don't ever see any kind of advertising or promotion for this place ... they'd be good to invest in some of that and put up a billboard around town here & there as the big Chinese buffets sometimes do ...\nSpeaking of which --- i'd love to see them offer an all you can eat buffet once or twice a week ... it would surely be a hit with all the scores of college kids who live in the area during the College school months ...

The bf and I were looking to see if there was any live music going on around town and found out that the band Andrew Jackson Jihad would be playing here so off we went. What we didn't think to do was buy tickets ahead of time, and we found out that the show was sold out, wah wah. However, the guy at the door told us that they often have people who need to sell a ticket so if we wanted to just hang out at the bar for a while we might luck out. So we plunked ourselves at the bar and proceeded to down some \"Canadian\" pints, which turned out to be 20 oz--4 oz more than standard US pints. Mind. Blown. Sure enough, after about half an hour, some people who needed to sell tickets turned up and we were in! The music venue is downstairs, in a pretty spacious basement-like space. The place was filled with young Calgarians hanging out and enjoying themselves, and we really liked the vibe--chill and casual. The sound was pretty good, and we enjoyed the bands a lot.

The party consisted of 12-15 people. My father pre-ordered quite a selection of food to be served buffet style.... He mistakenly ordered entirely too much food! Quite literally there was enough to feed 40-50 people easily. We had so much food in fact... Much to the chagrin of the staff, my dad offered food to the 8-10 college aged kids at the bay next to us which they were very delighted and accepted. There was so much food... Everybody was figuring out who was taking what but then \"the manager\" (what a tool) informed us we \"can't take any food home, it's against the health code\". If been to umpteen restaurants in Scottsdale and they always bring out a to-go box. I think the staff was extremely upset because they could see now that multiple bays next to us the guests were eating the \"catered food\" & was adversely affecting there business. Ridiculous. \n     Also, if you go there when it's hot, they have industrial unsightly misters that will do nothing but get your clothes damp/wet. My eyeglasses literally had to be wiped every 20 sec. When asked to adjust the settings, we were told there was \"nothing they could do\".\n     Finally, if you like to golf enough to where you own your own clubs... BRING THEM!  The \"house clubs\" are so bad and beat up. Top golf couldn't have bought them at even at a second hand store. These clubs would be something you'd find in your grandfathers attic from circa 1972. Oh and BRING YOUR MONEY AND BE READY TO PART WITH IT!!!\nSimply take a look around at their multi-million dollar facility.

While the drinks and food were great as usual, I had to give lower my rating because the service was shocking. I wanted to only bring it down to a 3-star rating, but considering the level of inappropriateness that we witnessed, I had to go with a 2 star.\n\nPlease note that my group and I were sitting in the bar area, which we acknowledge and respect can get quite busy. Regardless, the waitress would come by and try to take away our unfinished drinks so that we would order more. Oddly, trying to get their attention was very difficult especially when trying to get the bill. However, the real offender that forced me to write this review was how they handled sending us food we didn't order to our table.\n\nThe waitress placed a plate of calamari at our large table, which some people slowly started to munch on. We were all sharing platters, and no one realized that no one ordered calamari. The waitress then came back and informed us that it was another table who ordered it and took it away. The problem is that she then took the partially eaten plate to the other table who ordered it. We were all in shock. Even if we knew one person at the other table, you do not take a partially eaten meal from one table to another. You bring them a new plate.\n\nThis is why I had to bring down my rating from a four to a two.

The chef here, Justin Severino, gets mentioned in almost of those pieces.  \n\nWe chose Morcilla for a big birthday dinner for one of us (I'll leave it at that!), and the restaurant came through with flying colors for that occasion.\n\nSeverino is most renowned as a magician of cured meats, based on his original restaurant down the avenue, Cure.  Not surprisingly, Morcilla's got an outstanding selection of charcuterie.  It'd be easy get lost in this first section of the menu and have no appetite left over for anything else.  (In fact, Morcilla offers \"All of the Meats\" for 50 bucks, and any big party should take advantage of that.  Hell, maybe just you and you and a single guest should make a trip just for that purpose.)  But we forced ourselves to make some tough cured-meat choices, and the namesake morcilla (basically a spicy pork salami) and Surryano Ham turned out to be great ones.  (That Surryano, which is a steal here for $7, comes from the excellent Edwards Smokehouse in Tidewater Virginia, which had a huge fire not ago and tragically lost tons of product.  Get it while you can.)  \n\nWe also had the bacalao (codfish) en aceita, the \"Who Cooks for You\" salad (ground cherries, smoked goat cheese, candied pistachio, & peach-amontillado vinaigrette), and Spanish mackerel.  All terrific as well.\n\nWe wanted a little bit more, so we asked for the Cordero en Moreno (that was lamb meatballs in very North African yogurt sauce) and a half dozen oysters (out of Marblehead, Mass.).  More excellence.  \n\nThe staff handled the birthday stuff with understated aplomb, and our main server did her job well all night.\n\nMorcilla's got an attractive old-looking bar up front (even though the restaurant is almost brand new), and the back dining area has high vaulted ceilings and is comfortably and nicely appointed.  Only minor complaint with the whole experience is that the noise levels got kind of oppressive as the early evening became night.\n\nAll in all, easily one of the best two or three meals we've had all year.", "date": "2016-09-23 16:18:08"}

It was surprisingly quiet here.  Turns out that they opened very recently.  This will all change when baseball season starts.  They have a prime location right across the street from PNC.  We were greeted by the bartender who helped us pick a table.  Our server Krystal is the sweetest person ever.  She was very helpful with recommendations and advice and we appreciated that.\n\nFor my drink, I took a queue from Tim W.'s review and got the Thai Coconut Tea.  The drink was so so good, I had two.  Very refreshing.  BJ got his usual beer after trying a sample at the bar.\n\nWe started with the Goat Cheese Crostini with forest mushroom, honey and parsley.  Who doesn't want an appetizer with honey?  So good.  BJ got a Shrimp Po'Boy.  It was served with yummy fries and were delicious.  I got a Buffalo Chicken Salad.  It was not at all what I was expecting.   The chicken wasn't your usual deep fried battered variety swimming in red hot.  If I had read the menu more closely, I would have been inquiring as to what piri-piri chicken is.  It's basically chicken marinated in a hot chile pepper marinade, then grilled.  It was really a nice surprise.  And I loved the combination of arugula and romaine lettuces and thinly sliced fresh radishes.  I was very impressed with my salad.  \n\nTheir dessert choices were limited, but the choices sounded great!  They offer a chocolate lava cake and s'mores cheesecake which I was really wanting to try.  Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert.  We really liked BZ's and plan to visit again soon.", "date": "2013-01-19 16:05:41"}

Lately, my stylist has been AWOL, and I needed a cut pretty bad! I had to find a place and QUICK! I was kinda nervous though, because there have been times I walked out with my hair butchered, and even one time bald like Mr. Clean!(True story!), just out of desperation to get my hair did, and I didn't want that to happen again...\n\nWarren P. had mentioned Hi-Rollers located on E Charleston and Maryland Parkway to me a while back, and since we were heading in that direction, I decided to check Hi-Rollers out. Next door to the Huntridge Pharmacy, Hi Rollers is definitely a hidden gem. Those who know about it know what to expect. I've been to Hi-Rollers on three occasions, and I've been more than pleased each and every time. Love the vibe as you step inside, as if you went back in time to a shop of the 50s and 60's, cool pieces from Martin's personal collection and gifts decorate the walls(LOVE the Loteria cards and the Corona street sign which is Wifey's maiden name and Martin's last name!? Hmmmm...maybe they're related???)\n\nThe foursome of Martin, Chris, Caynen, and Chops make up the team at Hi-Rollers, with Levi being the shop keeper sweeping up, and making sure all supplies stocked up and replenished at all times. Being in business since 2010, these guys have earned a great reputation of being some of the best barbers in the business and it shows with each and every haircut. These guys even got their own sense of style every Tuesday and Saturday which are \"Dapper Days\". Yeah, they've gotten a write up in the Las Vegas Weekly, and were seen on Counting Cars and Pawn Stars, but after all the publicity, these guys still remain down to earth which is huge. This is not your usual \"turn and burn\" \"meet a  certain quota\" kind of establishment. These guys don't watch the clock. Instead, they're busy chatting up a storm among themselves and their clients just like you'd see in barber shop style movies which ALWAYS makes for a great time. Just know that if flicks like Blood In Blood Out, American Me, Rush Hour or Goodfellas are playing on the TV, your haircut/wait time will just take that much longer, but its all good. I'm sure if they had their own TV show it would be HILARIOUS! Like many say, its definitely worth the wait. Even the line out the door before they even open is proof. \n\nTheir hours are Tue.-Fri. 9 am-5 pm, and Sat. 9 am-4 pm(Closed Sunday, Monday and the first Tuesday of every month) and the best advice I can give you is get here early, and if you are #5 in line, you will have at least a 30 minute wait. (There are only four chairs, and four barbers) They do not take appointments or credit cards, so bring cash, grab a little bite to eat, and expect to spend a good couple hours of your day here. Another important thing to remember is to know who came before you, and who came after you. You don't pick numbers, just know your order. You may move up a bit quicker if someone has a certain barber they are waiting on. Haircuts start at $15 with fades starting at $19 and includes a warm cream/straight razor shave and a hot towel finish. This awesome experience is at least a minimum of 30-45 minutes and everyone I've seen walk out after being cut is totally satisfied. This is also your one stop shop for all your pomade needs to keep your wig tight where you can find top brands like Suavecito, Layrite, and Shiner Gold. Seriously some of the sweetest pompadours and side parts  I've seen.\n\nFellas, if you're searching for a spot that cuts, blends, shaves, and fades like nobody's business, you may want to check out Hi-Rollers.

On the doorstep looking in, there was not a single \"Peruvian-looking\" person aside from the staff.  Oh well.  \n\nThe resto is pretty small and tables are packed pretty close together. To get to the bathroom, you have to dance around the tables to find the best path.  That being said, you must reserve a table if you wish to eat on weekend nights!\n\nThe entree was pretty good, though the potato scoops were a touch too salty. \n\nAnticucho (when masterfully cooked) is a meatlover's dream.  It comes with a beautiful seared flavor, is savory, tender and juicy.  Unfortunately, the anticucho on the Piqueo Wellington was none of those :(  rubbery actually and somewhat tasteless. \n\nIf you want to have a taste of real good anticucho, go to Sanduchon in Cours Mont Royal and order the anticucho duck heart burger... Then, you'll know what Imma talking about!!! \n\nThe ceviche was a bit tough and fishy tasting. Now you may ask, \"Isn't fish supposed to taste fishy?\" Well, there's the fresh \"fishy\" taste which I love and the \"fishy fishy\" taste that I don't as much. Such was the case here.\n\nHowever, the calamari was delicious!  Tender, flavorful and very satisfying with a squeeze of lemon :)\n\nWas super excited to try the chicha morada here cause they say it's not powder but home made. Ordered a glass. The taste of cinnamon was too heavy and there was not enough tang to it. Overall, very average chicha morada. \n\nThe yucca fries and pork chiccharon were pretty good.  Satisfied with the way it was made! \n\nOverall, if you've not had authentic Peruvian before, this place is a good intro experience but nothing beats dining in Peru!", "date": "2017-12-02 10:10:46"}

With the giant chains in this industry on the decline, entrepreneurs are taking advantage of our nostalgia to deliver a combination of childhood pastimes and adult beverages.\n\nPerhaps the first thing you'll notice about Bonus Round is the stark contrast to many of the valley's similar establishments. Barcades tend to be dark and narrow, but this one is broad and brightly lit. This decision in atmosphere brings attention to the benches for communal seating, board games, and food. I haven't had anything from their limited menu, but snacks like ice cream sandwiches are welcome, and personal pizzas are a plus. Because I don't come to places like these for food, I can only assume they add to the experience. \n\nThe drink menu is actually very carefully thought out. As a beer lover, their acumen for choosing the right brews is much appreciated. They even had a custom beer made by Sun Up! In addition to this, there's a small but ambitious cocktail menu prepared by their very cool bartenders. \n\nWhen I say \"ambitious\", it is arguably to a fault. At 9-10 bucks a pop, it's competing with places like Hanny's, Valley Bar, and Sidebar...the list of above-average lounges to get a decent cocktail goes on.

Quite frankly, I don't think you can really get away with these in what looks and feels like a cafeteria, as I have no reason to prefer dropping beaucoup bucks on booze here over a dozen other spots. You have a casual atmosphere and food menu, so play to that strength. \n\nThe gaming itself is pretty cool, and they've committed to keeping them free! They've got the staples, like NBA Jam, NFL Blitz, and Street Fighter. Some other selections are great, like Silent Scope. Others are duds that haven't aged well, like Jurassic Park which is more fun to gawk at and pose in than play. Or their old-school Gauntlet game, which is really just a half hour button mashing session once you have unlimited lives. Overall, the selection does enough to keep you having fun for a couple hours, which is good. \n\nI think that overall, this is the barcade for nerds. I can envision myself downing a nice draught while I play something like MTG on your tables. There seems to be great opportunities to please gaming purists in a bright and relatively quiet space like this. I'd come here again whenever I'm in the mood to play games with close pals or a date. I would not come here to get rowdy on a weekend night, mingle with new people, or imbibe fine liquors. Still, I am happy for this addition to the valley and would be content with coming back.", "date": "2016-06-20 17:32:02"}

Not overly sweet and I seriously could just take a spoon to it. Lastly, my husband and I split a Reese's Personal cheesecake. Nice balance of flavors with a peanut butter base drizzled with chocolate and Reese's pieces. The cheesecake itself was not too dense (like a NY style) but not to fluffy. Great in-between texture.

I got the Light Rail Burger, which was juicy and had fresh ingredients on it. If you get a sandwich, make sure you get the homemade chips.

The dining area itself was crowded to the point that I could feel other customers hitting my chair constantly as they sat down.

I love that they serve filtered water, and I don't mind that they charge $0.50 for that.  They claim to be farm-to-table, but I'm not sure that we had any items that were local or organic. The jam and ketchup are made in house. The country sausage on the breakfast plate was really outstanding. \nThe average:  custard pancakes were very good, though nothing special compared to any other pancakes we've eaten. Syrup was served warm, but I couldn't taste maple syrup and I worry that it was just \"pancake syrup\" i.e. Cheap Imitation maple syrup. I could be wrong, but it doesn't taste like any maple syrup Ive eaten. Caramelized onion hash brown potatoes were very good. \nThe bad:  coffee was terrible!  I tried changing to another cup but still awful. Luckily the waiter was kind enough to remove it from our bill.  Service was a little slow considering there is both a waiter and an assistant waiter and the restaurant was not that busy.

Washington and experiencing the view from the Le Mont. OMG. What an impressive view, what impressive service, and yum impressive food. I really think that this made me want to come back and honestly I have been telling people all about it since I left. And that $38 dollar special menu. WOWZA you cannot say no to that!\n\nSo you walk in and you are surrounded by Christmas trees. And are welcomed by the host right away. You can either check your coat or take it with you. Since I was running a bit late (obviously) I opted to keep my coat with me. I was then escorted to the back area where I was seated. \n\nThe staff was so fast and efficient. The manager Dani who has been there for over 18 years told us that the staff have been there, some, over 30! That is crazy but these people really knew what they were doing. The table was beautifully decorated and had white and red wine already poured. The bread then was brought to the table and it was a basket of different types of bread. Yum. \n\nMain Course:\nI started with a garden salad with the house dressing. The dressing was very good and it wasn't overly poured as to soak the lettuce. I was happy that they went light on the dressing so I could enjoy the meal. The salad was nice and a good little starter.\n\nThen I enjoyed the surf and turf. I mean I licked my plate clean. The steak was done so tenderly that I didn't even need to use a knife if I didn't want. The turf was two jumbo shrimps that were skewered and buttered. The plate had a side of buttered goodness in a little dish that could be used to dip in the shrimp or the mashed potatoes. Now, those mashed potatoes.... They were fluffy and made into a little mountain. You almost didn't want to eat them since they were so pretty. The other side was then some broccolini and some other mixed veggies. It was really good and I ate everything on my plate. The plate was seasoned to perfection and nothing about it was bad. \n\nDessert:\nI got the creme brulee for the dessert portion of my meal. I will say that aesthetically it was very pleasing but the brulee was not like anything I have ever tried. Brulee is my favorite dessert so I have tried it a lot of times. This one did not have the crunch that most brulee has. It was more sugary at the top, like it was not flamed enough for the crust to form.

Yeah, you know it's kinda true. \n\nIt is NOT AYCE. However, I thought that the Moo and Woo combos were reasonably priced at around $60 and they are appropriate portions (they feed 2-3, and we were a group of 3). Along with sides, you also receive a steamed egg, cheese corn, and your choice of available soups. \n\nThey do the cooking for you, which is a nice change of pace. However, I wish that they had disclosed this information when we informed them that it was our first time eating at Moo Woo. It would have made things slightly less awkward and confusing. \n\nIf you like to eat a lot, if you prefer and can handle AYCE better because you like the wide range of things you can order, this is probably not the place for you. It's more along the lines of..a casual date with a friend...a romantic outing with your hubby...or maybe you just wanted Korean BBQ but you're so lazy that you don't want to cook it yourself. \n\nI was pretty impressed to eat here. For a location on the NW side, Moo Woo would probably be getting a 5 star rating if it weren't for the many neighbor's meats I saw that the attending cook let overcook on accident.

Well, not quite.  \n\nFirst let me start with the owner and chief cook is a retired Marine.  Thank you for not only serving our country, but devoting a huge part of your life to keeping the bad guys at bay.   I would continue to patronize this business for this reason alone.  He is very nice to visit with when there is a lull in the customer line.  There was a steady flow of customers.  Probably half of the customers were fire and EMT staff from various departments while I was eating.\n\nThe new restaurant was spotless and smelled great.  The smoker is in the center back of the open kitchen with firewood stacked beside it.  The wait staff is young, but closely supervised from the kitchen.  There is no permanent sign outside yet, but they are in the Goodyear super Walmart complex near I10 in the south east corner of the parking lot next to a beauty supply store.\n\nThe food is good, you will not be disappointed.  I was hoping for fantastic.  The first sign there might be trouble was when I saw two microwave ovens above the prep table.  That is never good.  Microwaves dry and toughen proteins.  Nothing destroys perfectly cooked food faster than a microwave oven.\n\nI ordered a sampler plate of pulled pork, chopped beef brisket, smoked sausage, pork and beef ribs.  Sides were baked beans, potato salad and coleslaw.  Everything was served in take out Styrofoam.   The meats were in a large container swimming in barbecue sauce.  Good sauce, but way too much.  I'll ask for sauce on the side next time.  \n\nThe pulled pork was excellent.  Great taste, tender and moist.  The chopped beef brisket was chewy and dry tasting even though sitting in sauce.  The ribs were delicious and fall off the bone tender - in the middle.  The ends were tough and dry.  Except for the pulled pork, this is what is expected from microwaved food.  \n\nThe potato salad was OK.  It tasted like commercial bought product.  The beans were tasty but the texture was very mushy.  I suspect they were canned beans with added ingredients.  \n\nThrow out the microwaves, reheat proteins in an oven or griddle, make the sides from scratch and this will be a Yelp 5+ star restaurant.

This is the place to do it.  Grab the Groupon and prepare to climb, jump, fall, twist, and flip for a few hours with a good group of other very random people.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed \"trapeze enthusiast in spirit\", I fully expected half the class to be training, and the other half to be attempts to remember our training, getting up to swing once or twice.  Call it a day, reflect on how poorly / awesome we did, and grab drinks back at the hotel.\n\nThis was...not the case.  After 5 solid minutes of training (hold the bar, try and swing, try and tuck and flip once or twice) we were climbing the ladder up to the platform, and were fully expected to just jump off and try to be amazing.\n\nWell, the learning-by-doing concept worked for most of us.  We had a class of 12 or so people, and they harnessed us up, put us in an order, and...we were jumping.\n\nThe first few times...jump off, try and get your legs up and under.  The next few times...do the same thing, but then let go, look backwards, lift back up, jump off.  Maybe you flipped off at the end.  Maybe you just let go.  Either way, you are harnessed in with a net below, so even if you decided to completely let go mid-swing, you would land very bouncy-bouncy and safe-like, eager to try it again.\n\nThe skill level of our class varied, there were a few residents of Vegas that were regulars and were practicing trapeze on a completely different level than we were.  Novice or pro - doesn't matter.  The instructors will assess your skill level and provide the very encouraging guidance you need to get better with each swing.  They were fantastic the whole time - I think we went an extra 45 minutes just because we were having that much fun.  Even when you completely suck (you'll know it when you do it), they will provide fully positive and encouraging feedback.  Each swing was captured on camera, so they could review your swing and show you what you did well and where you went wrong.\n\nEven with a class of 12, I was able to get up there 5 or 6 times.  The grand finale was the perfect execution of your swing, leg curl, and swing backwards to coincide with an instructor on another bar, ready to grab your hands a-la professional style, wherein you let go, and get swung around a little under their control before you drop.\n\nNot everyone got there, i'd say about 70% of our class executed it.  I don't mind saying I wasn't one of them, I just didn't get my legs up in time.  It happens.  \n\nThis is why there are more visits to Vegas, more Groupons, and more attempts at trapeze mastery.", "date": "2015-09-16 00:12:09"}

It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....\n\nI was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their \"Tonkotsu Assari\" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  \n\nIt's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  \n\nTo my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.

Party of six and I made reservations for 7pm.  Hubby and I ordered off their autumn special menu for $39.99 for a set menu of 3 courses- appetizer, main course, and dessert.  I ordered their butternut squash soup, their lamb shank, and apple streusel.\n\nWhat's hot\n- Valet parking.  I don't generally do valet parking, but you don't really have a choice here.  Parking is super limited.  However, it's $7 total, not per hour.  Given the givens, that's not so bad.  They were timely, polite, and no mistakes.\n- Quality.  My lamb shank was fall off the bone tender.  Their wedge salad had beets and a good amount of bacon.  Food was nicely seasoned.  However, nothing seemed to stand out (see below for further explanation). \n- Portions.  Good amount, especially given the price.  Enough food and we left full.\n- The view.  Fantastic and definitely can't be beat, especially at night.\n- Service.  Decent service, but they do get busy, so be aware.  Additionally, they're very old school.  For example, they take the orders of the women before men.  \n\nWhat's not\n- Live music.  Different strokes for different folks.  I'm sure there are some who enjoy live music.  It wasn't bad.  However, it does make having conversation very difficult.  \n- Maitre D tip.  I think a maitre d is the head waiter?  Not sure.  On our tab, there were 2 tip sections, one for our waiter and one for the maitre d.  We didn't give a maitre d tip, cuz we don't know who that is.  Additionally, 2 tips.  Really?   \n- Price.  For hubby and myself, it cost over $80, including tip.  Definitely not a place you go to on a regular basis.  This place is special occasions only.\n- Quality.  Not bad, but we've had better.  Hubby ordered the sirloin steak at medium.  When he cut into his steak, there was no pink.  The food isn't bad, but we've had better.\n- Service.  I made a reservation and our group still had to go wait about 10-15 mins for them to get our table ready.  To be fair, this place looks popular, but still sucked to be waiting especially given that I made a reservation.

First, I would like to thank SRP for the monster power surge that set fire to the electrical board in my dryer.  They shall be receiving my gratitude in the form of a claim for $300.\n\nNaturally, I discovered the problem on a Friday afternoon.  My first call to another highly rated appliance repair business resulted in an answer of \"I can probably get to it Monday or Tuesday.  Text me your information.\"  Apparently, he was too busy to collect my information or actually give me an appointment.  Not to mention it would take me 27 minutes to text my address & phone on my flip phone as well as a refresher course on how to type a number.  Forget it.\n\nSo I called Appliance Works.  They actually tried to work me in the same afternoon, but when the repairman got tied up on another call, they promptly called to let me know he would have to come the next day, a Saturday.  And he did come in the window I was given.  Although I assumed it was the board, he stated it was only a blown fuse and would be a mere $130 to repair.  Unfortunately, he had to leave for over an hour to get the fuse.  After he came back, he realized it was the board and would really be $270.  He forgot that a Frigidaire had to be tested differently.  I could forgive that since he was relatively young.  The kicker was that the part would not be in until the following Friday.  I expressed I could not wait that long and was considering just buying a new set.  It was only after we asked if there was any way to get the part sooner that he offered to have it expressed.  It was to get here on Tuesday.\n\nTuesday came and went, and I did not hear from Appliance Works, so I called on Wed morning.  The gal I spoke with contacted the technician and through some miscommunication advised me the tech did not know if the part was in.  I wasn't happy about paying an extra $30 for rush unnecessarily.  She had the tech call me himself and he clarified the part had come in on Tuesday, but not until late.  He was going to confirm the right part had been ordered before calling.  He did follow up and came that evening to fix it.  Again, he was on time and the repair was made at the quoted price.  He also gave me a detailed receipt so that I can file a claim.\n\nAlthough there were a few snags, Appliance Works was very accommodating in scheduling me promptly.

Everything that was 'taught' in the class I had already learned from my sewing machine manual, You Tube videos, or just using common sense.

I've rarely eaten in one of those places and was disappointed!  \n\nThis is Phoenix's amazing stab at the good life of trucking good food that Food trucks in places like NYC provide.  In my opinion, Phoenix knocks it out of the park!   The event happens every Friday during the lunch time from 11-1:30pm.  The trucks form a perfect rectangle around the tables in the middle, making it easy for you to eyeball your next stop while you chomp down on your food.\n\nFood truck Friday's has been on my to-do-list for a while.  After hearing how good the Jamborritos were at the recent Food TV food truck event that was held a couple Saturdays ago on the coldest day in Phoenix in a couple years, I decided I would check it out and today was perfect at 70 degrees!  :-)  \n\nI came there with a friend and a very highly opinionated 3 y/o who is ripe for a Yelp! account of her very own!   So, we visited the Short Leash Dogs to get the 3 y/o's meal outta the way!  \n\nWe walked around the perimeter of the trucks to observe the menus of the other trucks and make mental notes of where we wanted to visit the next time.  Our mission was to try the Jamborrito's from Jamborrito!  The food there didn't let us down.  What I like best about each truck that we stopped by to say \"hi\" and read the menus is that EVERYone is so friendly and chatty.  I like talking and I love chatty people.\n\nFor those that are visiting and are not familiar with the parking situation in that area, there is some street parking.  there is a strange parking lot directly south of the PPM where you can park.  you must pay cash.  Today, each parking space was $6 and you slip the cash in the slot for your parking spot number.  There are other parking lots around, but I don't know on a weekday if those lots are free or paid.  On the weekend, for the PPM, they are free.\n\nMy one and only complaint about this place is that there aren't more trucks!   LOL, but other than that, this is such a wonderful and great atmosphere to enjoy.", "date": "2013-01-26 01:03:35"}

Their website is very user friendly and explains everything you need to know from prices to hours. \n\nIf you have ever been to SkyZone, this place seems to be run very similarly. \n\nPros:\nGreat prices: especially if you have a kid under 6! There is a toddler time during the week where kids jump for a discounted price and adults can jump for $2. \n\nThe place is very clean!!! The foam in the foam pit is brand new as well as the dodgeballs. Doesn't smell bad. I've been to some trampoline parks that smell like feet and this one doesn't, so that's a plus.\n\nEmployees everywhere!!! In every section of trampolines there was an employee in a bright orange t shirts. Most of them were so interactive playing with all the kids, my daughter was having so much fun with them. \n\nCons:\nSome of the employees are not interactive at all. They just stand there... one little girl was having some trouble getting her beam onto the balance beam and the employee just stood there while she struggled. Another little kid ended up helping her. However, some employees are TOO interactive. I literally watched an employee hit a kid HARD in the face with a dodgeball. I understand it was an accident, but still. \n\nThe girl I was helped by in the front desk needs some training. I went in during \"Toddler Time\" where kids under 6 are discounted and the parent jumps for only $2.... well the employee FIRST charged full price for 1 child and 1 adult. When I asked her about toddler time, she changed it. The SECOND time she charged the discount price for 1 child but still charged full price for 1 adult. I finally showed her THEIR menu and explained that I should only get charged $2 for me. She seemed surprised like she didn't know that was an option. Someone else came to help her and corrected everything but the lady should have been showing ME the deal, not the other way around. \n\nThis isn't really negative or positive, but I didn't see a system in place to let people know when they are done jumping. Obviously if I paid for an hour I should stop jumping after an hour, but since I wasn't keeping track of time, my daughter kept jumping past our paid time. I did notice different colored wristbands. \n\nOverall, we will be back. This place is still new so I think the cons I'm talking about will get sorted out as time goes on. My daughter had fun and that's all that matters. It's a fun place that is still working on perfecting everything.", "date": "2017-06-29 20:10:29"}

It was a little awkward to scoop the dip since it was so thick, but it was still a good choice.  For our meals, we had the Sloppy Pat and the Chicken and Brie Cheese Sandwich.  Both were great, I especially loved the chicken sandwich.  Both meals were served with steak fries (chips for you Irish folk)  They were very crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  We ate them in traditional fashon with vinegar rather than catsup.  \n\nWe also had a few New Castles and a Harp.  Both were nice and cold and tasted great.\n\nOverall, the $60-ish we spent on our meal and drinks were a pretty darn good deal in my opinion (we had spent $18 on two hotdog meals the prior day on the casino floor)  Great alternative to a buffet, food is much better quality and left me as much, if not more satisfied.", "date": "2013-02-25 22:30:14"}

We decided on the Manhattan package which was the most expensive but we knew it made more sense with the additional things that would end up costing us equal if not more at the end. You will end up having a vendor night where you go and meet several djs. Oscar was the most amazing dj and kept out guests dancing all night and made our ceremony music sound beautiful. He has such a great personality and was a pleasure to work with. We also picked our florist Jan Dekker, we knew by her adding some greenery before our eyes with a simple arrangement at the open house that she has a good eye. She showed us her other floral events and she does beautiful work and it showed on our wedding day. Lastly we picked our photographer Troy which is such a cool guy. He ended up traveling to Sedona with us to take our engagement pictures (it came with our package ( not including travel) because we asked him if he could make the trip to Sedona.  He was a delight to work with during our big day and evening. Very cool and can go with the flow for a bride like me :) I had my big white tent I always saw for my wedding with the beautiful scenery I envisioned. It was a great memory I loved and wish could have gone by slower. Thank you to our team we were so happy with our choices and how hard they all worked. Christy was a great wedding coordinator!!!", "date": "2017-04-15 03:59:50"}

Majority of the guests were in their 50-60s. \n\nWe saw pork belly on the yelp reviews but alas there weren't any when we went. We ordered the claim chowder and the bruschetta as apps. The chowder was nice but didn't stand out. I guess I should say it was pleasant. For the bruschetta we chose the goat cheese, the wild mushrooms, and the olives. We both really liked the goat cheese with the carmelized onions. Although both of us felt that it would be even better if the goat cheese was warm. I liked the mushrooms and my gf liked the olives.\n\nFor entree we picked the beef short ribs, the elk o'bucco, and the crab cakes. The crab cakes were seasoned well and very yummy. The Elk was very dry. It's definitely missing a component of fat to address the dryness. The short rib was much better texture wise. My gf and I both felt that the elk and the beef were vastly under seasoned and needed salt. \n\nThe service was pleasant and the place definitely has potential to be quite good.

In fact they take it as far as they can without pushing over-the-top for trying way too hard.\n\nThe Lady Silvia is certainly not a hipster bar as some have suggested.  They do things too well here for the hipster to love on it.  The clientele is not comprised of hipsters.  The drinks & the prices do not speak  to the hipster.  Having said my peace  there I can now continue to review...\n\nThe drinks are one of the areas that prevent The Lady Silvia from attaining 5 stars.  There are several solid classic cocktails, as well as a few original creations that are enjoyable.  The drinks just fall a little short...lacking balance and proper execution generally speaking.  The prices have dropped from when I first came in though--the house crafted drinks going for $10 or $11 as opposed to $15.  \n\nThe bartenders also earn the 4 star mark...better than the average bar tender, but not the exceptional mixologist that I would expect upon entering into The Lady Silvia.\n\nThe Lady Silvia also has a wide array of events and weekly alterations to their normal business flow.  This is not good or bad in and of itself.  I am not into their attempt to be a sports bar during football nights, but others appreciate it I'm sure.\n\nThey also offer some CLASSIC Spanish style tapas for a couple of bucks.  They make for some nice snacks while you drink.\n\nFor me the hero is the ambiance and atmosphere.  And I will return again for that.  The Lady Silvia is a perfect place to come with a group of 4 - 6 friends who want to relax, enjoy some conversation on some uber cool couches, and have some good drinks....the pictures do not begin to do justice to the decor inside.\n\nThe Lady Silvia also lacks any sign.

Quite busy as it was the lunch hour and right across the street from the Court house so a lot of county employees. Plus they offered a free taco for their grand opening which was an additional draw. The location is shared with the future Sultan's Grill, in a food court like open space. The tables appeared were mismatched and at least a few of them appeared to be purchased used, possibly from a shut down Italian cafe, as they had Italian pictures painted on them and the chairs had paint chipping off which again indicates, used furniture, neither here nor there just making observations. They were not completely ready as they are still painting the logo on the wall and making other adjustments including not having all the menu items there for purchase yet. \n\nSo as to the rating, I went back and forth on what to rate them - I know I have high standards and am critical and I know I am especially critical of taco places. Just having eaten at Taco y Taco last week and being a fan of Tacos El Gordo and Los Antojos, I just expect or prefer a authentic experience. Cilantro (which does not appear to be affiilated with the Cilantro on Rainbow/Smoke Ranch) appears to be a chain, or at least have three other locations, in the Chicago area - and they state \"A Taste of Chicago\". Now, maybe I don't know much about Chicago but tacos are not the first thing that comes to mind when I think Chicago food. \n\nI ordered three tacos, barbacoa, al pastor and asada. The tacos were on corn tortillas and street taco style and size. I thought it was a bit pricey at $2 a pop. The meat did not have a lot of flavor and the barbacoa was quite fatty, and yes I know it is pork which is fatty but I bit into chunks of fat. That being sad the barbacoa was probably my favorite of the group - fat = flavor. Also ordered a tamale, I asked and they said it was house made. I ordered the pork, it was really really dry - so I doused it with hot sauce. The tamale was $2. I tried to order the chile relleno taco but they don't have chile relleno's yet. \n\nAs to the service, maybe they are still working out the kinks as they just opened today but it was painfully, and I mean painfully slow - and 7 people working behind the counter. Plus, they need a microphone or a different way of calling out the numbers because they call the orders by number and it was really hard to hear them and in fact the customers were talking and relaying the numbers called amongst themselves. \n\nAlso, I think that It would benefit them to provide a salsa bar to their patrons. They only provided salsa in bottles, likely house made but there was a green (tomatillo) salsa which was salty and did not have a lot of flavor, at least to me, and then a red spicier salsa. But the number of bottles were limited, I was lucky enough to snag a red one, but there were not enough for every table. Maybe they expect patrons to use the salsa bottles and leave them up there for others but I like to have ample salsa while I am dining.\n\nAfter all this - I really do wish them well as they are a new business, and I am sure there is a segment of the population that will love and adore their food.

It's fun and cheeky and sexy and all that stuff I kind of anticipated from a burlesque show, but it was also something entirely different. \n\nI liked the way Lucy put it, as the Master of Ceremonies for the evening, burlesque classes (and these performances) are more than dancing or taking off clothes, they are about coming to an expression and appreciation for who you are - regardless of how you think you look, your gender or sexual orientation. This is a beautiful sentiment - and one that most people might recite as some kind of Martin-Luther-King-esque-platitude - but Romantasy Cabaret lived it during this performance. \n\nThere was a joy and an abandon to the performances that was inspiring. It was a celebration of all things and all people. It was a blast. Obviously - this is an adult oriented show of an erotic nature - but breasts and asses and beautiful women of all shapes and sizes aren't the point! It's just a wonderful side benefit to the celebration of life on display. \n \nI thoroughly enjoyed it and left inspired.

I hope not, because I'm already thinking about when I can make my next appointment!\n\nI checked out Body Blitz East two weekends ago as a birthday treat to myself.  I booked my appointment about 1.5 weeks ahead of time.  They didn't have space available for me to have a scrub AND a massage, so I opted for just the scrub.  It was admittedly a bit disappointing because if you add a massage to your treatment, you get it at a reduced rate  That being said, I was bound and determined to enjoy a spa day for my birthday, so I settled for just a scrub.\n\nI arrived early in the morning (9:30AM on a Saturday), and I'm glad I did.  When I entered the waters, there was only one other person present in the sea salt pool (and two in the sauna).  When I readying myself to leave (post treatment, around 12:00PM) there were a few large (and noisy) groups getting ready to start the circuit.  When I visit again, I will once again opt for a first-thing in the morning circuit.  The room is large and echo-y, and I can imagine my experience wouldn't have been as stellar if I found myself in the pool with a large bridal shower party.  There are signs everywhere asking patrons to respect other spa-goers, but I can imagine this isn't always the case with these larger groups.\n\nI really enjoyed the water circuit.  I've done water treatments before at other spas, but I've never felt as relaxed as I did at Body Blitz.  When I first stepped into the pool, I was a bit worried I'd be bored without my phone or tablet (I know, I'm the worst).  Once I actually let myself relax, I relished being away from these distractions for 1.5 hours.  The time flew by.  I did the circuit as recommended the first time around and then adjusted based on my preferences the second time.  I loved getting an iced tea brought to me poolside.  I felt so pampered.  There was a spa attendent overseeing the waters and change rooms, but I never felt her presence to be intrusive.\n\nAs 11:00 neared, I rinsed off in the handy pool-side showers, and waited in the luxurious lounge chairs for my treatment.  Brittany showed up promptly at 11:00 and ushered me upstairs for my body scrub.\n\nI will admit - if you're not comfortable with a perfect stranger seeing you in various states of undress, a body scrub is not for you.  The room I was brought to featured little more than a large, vinyl-cushioned table, a stool, a hose, a heat lamp, and a disposable thong for you to wear.  You CAN opt to have the scrub done in your bathing suit, but I'm not shy.  Disposable thong it is!\n\nThe treatment started with a full body wash down while I lay on the slab, face-down, followed by the salt scrub.  After that half was finished, I was flipped over for the same treatment on the front of my body.  My eyes were covered with a warm towel (protection from the bright light of the heat lamp), and I admit that there was a moment, as my mostly unclothed body was being hosed down, it felt a TEENSY bit like I was lying on a coroners slab.  Having not treated myself to many experiences like this before it took some getting used to, but I just reminded myself that I was being pampered, not prepped for autopsy.\n\nAfter the scrubbing was completed, I was dried down (as was the table).  Looking at the clock, I was curious how the next 35 minutes of my 60 minute treatment would be spent.  I was delighted to learn that remainder of the time would be spent moisturizing my body from head to toe.\n\nOnce my treatment was over, I wasn't as upset that I didn't get my add-on massage, because Brittany massaged moisturizer into every part of me, with special attention paid to my disgusting runners feet, and my office-job forearms.  After 60 minutes I felt like a whole new person!  It may not have been RMT, but it was relaxing and rejuvenating!\n\nI was so delighted with my first Body Blitz experience!  From being provided with a robe, towels, flip flops, and a locker (so I could pack light) to small touches like the fresh lilies in wall-mounted vases in the washrooms, Body Blitz was just what I needed to usher in a new year.\n\nSome complain that Body Blitz is on the pricey side.  My scrub cost $140 (before tax), but that included access to the waters (which cost around $50 on a normal day, I believe).  As well, Body Blitz does not allow for tipping.  I didn't ask why.  So before tax, my 60-minute scrub could be said to cost around $90, and was worth every penny.  For me, I can definitely see myself earmarking $140 every couple months or so to enjoy this experience once again.", "date": "2014-07-28 16:00:13"}

The place looked nice and the staff was friendly. They had a pretty decent sized menu and I was debating on a couple of things.

The down side was that they advertised they had the best bloody Mary's and it wasn't good at all. It said it had a fresh tomato pinwheel & bacon, and mine was only served with a green bean, olive, and lemon. And the mix wasn't good either, not very flavorful and  tasted watered down. And I'm sure this would be different if I was going back to my house or something, but the portions were monstrous! I'm one of those people who hates wasting food and there is absolutely no way I would be able to finish any of the plates they had there. I wish they would've told us how extremely big the portions were and we could have split something. And again if I would've been going home I could've taken leftovers, but we were walking the strip so that wasn't an option. Since I hate wasting food, we overstuffed a Togo box, which shows how much food we both had left, and gave it to a homeless group on the strip asking for food.

It was an extremely underwhelming meal, and I left thinking 'Pft, not comin' back here...'. \n\nAlas, a girlfriend of mine celebrated her birthday this weekend and wanted to dine at the high-end (read: overpriced) diner. So, I walked into the joint with a smile and hopeful expectations. Unfortunately, mediocrity literally greeted me at the door.  I was the first to arrive, and was seated by a bored gentleman who felt no need to show me the drinks list or menu while I waited. Once the other girls arrived, we were taken care of by a rushed waitress who immediately offered the disclaimer 'I don't speak English.' Good thing we weren't tourists from Connecticut. While I am relatively bilingual, I do expect that wait staff and other service professionals should be able to address me in English. However this is a tired Quebec argument that I don't have the patience to discuss further. \n\nOur service was very slow, and our food was a 6.5 at most. While I understand that Greasy Spoon offers small portions, the resto should at least offer good food to compensate for its pricing. I ordered the salmon tartar and octopus salad, and both left me cold (and hungry). My overly spicy tartar was gone after two bites, and I was then left with a mound of tasteless potato chips- certainly not worth $14. My next course consisted of heavily oiled and mushy potatoes, topped with a few nibbles of rubbery octopus. \n\nOur dirty dishes (though not entirely empty- we left behind the revolting tater tots) sat at the table for quite a while before our waitress cleared them. She didn't offer us a second round of drinks or dessert, so we decided it was time to cut our losses and bounce. Much to our dismay, we were held hostage for another 20 minutes waiting for her to return with card machines. I was seriously contemplating a dine and dash, but a random staff member swooped in at the last second. What had become of our waitress? Frankly, we didn't care...", "date": "2012-01-08 19:17:00"}

We had gone to our app and put ourselves on the waiting list, but still had to wait over a half hour once we arrived.  The bar here isn't set up well, because if you can't get a seat, there is no where to stand.   We all would have had a drink while waiting, but it wasn't possible.  \n\nOnce we were finally seated, we waited 22 minutes before a server came to take our drink order.   That's crazy to me.   I know they were busy, but at least stop by and say you will be back soon.   \n\nWe had received an email that offered a free appetizer so we ordered the lettuce wraps.    Our drinks finally arrived and the appetizer shortly after that.   These might be the worst lettuce wraps I have ever had.   The lettuce leaves were huge and crunchy, but we were given the smallest bowl of filling I have ever seen.   The 4 of us each had one, but maybe had 2 teaspoons of filling in them.   The sauces were both tasty, but the filling itself was bland.\n\nThe menu is extensive and some things are repeated, so it becomes confusing.  I opted for the half rack of ribs, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Food came in a timely manner and was at least warm.   The ribs had a great flavor with a bit of spice, but there was hardly any meat on them, which was disappointing at the price they charged.  The mashed potatoes were good, but the asparagus was over cooked and over peppered.   \n\nOthers had the Parmesan crusted chicken and the jambalaya and were ok with their meals.  \n\nWhen our bill arrived, she had not deducted the appetizer even though she had the information on the coupon, so we had to wait for that.\n\nI want to like this place because it has a varied menu and we have had better experiences at other locations.

When I went, the dining rooms were quite full, but all the diners looked unhappy.  The harried waiter said that we coudl eat there, but it would take 1.5 hours to get our food due to the kitchen and servers being too busy. It was not laziness on his part, but rather that there were 2 servers for 2 dining rooms. I saw diners who looked very unhappy with nothing in front of them. We quickly left.\n\nI returned in 2014 for dinner and fortunately it was not the chaos we previously encountered. The layout of the restaurant is very odd--I get the feeling it would be more successful if they didn't have 2 dining rooms. At night, the curtains to the dining room are halfway  up; however, it doesn't block the headlights of cars that park directly in front of the building so you get big shining lights in the restaurant if someone's starting up their car.\n\nWhen asked, we said that we were OK sitting anywhere in the restaurant, which was at less than 25% of capacity. Yet we were placed in a table in view of the restroom.  \n\nI'm not sure our server checked on how we were doing 1x while we were eating.  The dishes were really expensive; you basically have 3 kinds of main entrees and a lamb tagine is $17 with no sides or appetizers.  As for the food, if you told me that the tagine was from any part of the world, I would have believed you. It did not have any distinctive flavor other than meat&veggie stew.  The b'stilla, a dish with cinnamon, sugar, eggs, pastry dough, and chicken, was all right but a little more quiche-like than being encrusted in pastry.\n\nI am very glad we had a Bucky Book coupon as this was not worth the full price, and I don't really consider it to be worth the coupon price either.", "date": "2014-10-01 17:11:13"}

They have a whole gluten free menu with wonderful selections.  \n\nThe first time I went there was right before Thanksgiving so they had a gluten free pumpkin pie as well as their regular gluten free chocolate dessert.  Our server brought me a piece on the house.  I was so happy I almost cried.  Pumpkin pie is something I was really sad I couldn't have (my mother later found a great GF recipe for pie crust and whipped up one for me, but I didn't know this at the time) and he was so sweet to bring me some for free when I had a hard time deciding which dessert to try.  \n\nI try to venture out on the menu, but I always end up with the babyback ribs because they're SO delicious.  The mashed potatoes have nutmeg in them and are to die for.  The shoestring fries are really good too.  The honey glazed carrots are also tasty.  Everything I've had has been top notch.  They've got it all at WCG-great food, great drinks, great desserts, great atmosphere, and great service.  \n\nThe wait can be long but you may be able to make reservations; I'm not sure, as I've never tried.  \n\nThe patio is even nice in the Winter if it's not TOO cold (which, in this part of AZ, it typically isn't), because it's mostly walled in and has heat lamps.    \n\nYou can dress up or down and it's appropriate either way, but I guess if I had to pick, it's on the nicer side probably.

It gets busy and when it does, customers are left to wait in the tiniest foyer and sometimes even outside. A majority of the time, customers are waiting with the door open staring at you eating your food. And when it's cold, you don't want that damn door open with cold air on your hot ramen.

It was quite simply just an amazing culinary experience, the best Japanese dishes I have ever tasted.\n\nSmall restaurant space but cozy, cultural and unique. (It's what I would expect in Tokyo) The staff are extremely friendly and the chefs work at god speed. The dishes are not expensive at all for both the quantity and especially the quality, the usual individual bowls and dishes are about $15-20 each. We decided to try just about everything we were interested in on the menu, and ended up spending about $40-$50 per person. The uniqueness of the dishes is hard to find elsewhere in North America. The 1 hour of waiting on hungry stomach while blocking sidewalk traffic on the street? WELL worth it. I would have waited for another 2 hours if need be.\n\nThe ambiance of this place may not be ideal for a date who expects the sophistication of fine dining. But have been raised in China, I love this tiny place where people can sit side by side and watch the chefs work their magic and truly experience the amazing dishes with the culture. Doodles of the menu items are scattered across the walls of the restaurant, quite sweet and special. \n\nTuna Belly - This is got to be the best fish I have ever tasted. With a price tag of $35, you get a gigantic dish that's cooked to beyond perfection. The meat is tender and the texture is so soft that it melts in your mouth, the fresh taste of the tuna meat is not lost in this perfectly flavored dish. We found ourselves flipping the fish over and over many times to try to find anything that's left to eat.\n\nShrimp Burger - I ordered this for my main dish. It's definitely the most unique thing I have tasted, chunks of shrimp is pressed into a burger patty, lightly seasoned, sitting in between two lightly grilled buns topped with fresh lettuce leafs and tomato slices, as well as an extra hint of crispy from rice crispies. Light and fresh, without the usual greasiness associated with burgers, special and excellent.\n\nTuna Tartare and Salmon Tuna Bowl - Both dishes contain raw fish, high grade salmon and tuna sliced into small chunks, paired with seasoned sticky rice and veggies. There was no extra taste of 'seafood' in the dish at all for those who doesn't fancy raw fish for that reason.\n\nGrilled Shrimp - This is probably among one of the heaviest thing we ordered - flavor wise, and it didn't taste heavy or greasy at all. Three extra large shrimps plated with tomato, sesame seeds, sitting in a special grill marinate. The shrimp's flavor is so intense and concentrated it's quite amazing, the grilling is done to a perfect level - you could taste the extra flavor coming from the grilling alone.\n\nGyoza - 4 gyozas pan fried and plated carefully as an appetizer, with the perfect proportion of meat (inside) to dough (outside). The grilled bottom thin and crispy, the sides thin and soft, and the inside juicy and tender. \n\nMatcha Ice Cream - Homemade ice cream with matcha powder on top. Heavenly! The bitter taste of matcha combined with the slightly sweet ice cream. Almost make you want to lick the little ice cream teacup.\n\nWe ordered various other dishes and it's not an exaggeration to say that everything was cooked to exact perfection.\n\nKazu really gets it, the true meaning of perfection and has earned its special place in this food-enthusiast's heart.", "date": "2012-06-21 16:07:30"}

Hunan in Solon is clearly the dramatic exception!\n\nThe food at Hunan is authentic - not just \"close\".   Full of marvelous flavor and character, I particularly enjoy their barbecue spare ribs (appetizer, $7.00), Cantonese-style roast duck ($15.00), and choy sum with oyster sauce (requested, off the menu).  Of course their menu offers the complete \"standard fare\" known at area Chinese restaurants but at a far better quality.  For the more adventurous, some of Hunan's more flairful entr\u00e9es include Singaporean Chow Ho Fun ($10.00), Tangerine Beef ($12.00), Lamb Scallion ($12.00), and Beef Yau Tsoi Portabella Mushroom ($13.00).\n\nThe interesting thing is Hunan incorporates other Asian palates into their menu, including Korean (like the spare ribs appetizer I mentioned) and Thai, such as fresh spring wraps and a complete line-up of Thai curries available in 9 meat/seafood/vegetarian selections.  I would estimate their offerings weigh in between 75% Chinese and 25% other Asian.  Typically this is a dangerous premise for a restaurant to attempt - but Hunan's execution of this diversity is flawless and spot on!\n\nThe cost ranges from average to a shade under pricey for the less mainstream, more exotic items in regard to the price-to-portion ratio.  However, once you sample the cuisine you will quickly discover you are clearly getting what you pay for.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the industrial side of Solon, easily accessible south of 422, across the complex of small hotels.  Use caution: it's relatively small and insignificant-looking in the small strip mall it's situated in and can easily be overlooked.\n\nSome may criticize that Hunan is still Americanized or Anglo-Chinese.  True.  It is important to keep in mind this is the best Chinese Restaurant in the area but it must still cater to the NEO palate.  Personally, it is not 100% what I'm used to in Singapore, Honolulu, or San Francisco but for Hunan to mimic that level of authenticity and expect to stay in business in NEO would be unwise.  On the positive side, Hunan Solon has successfully bridged that crossover well enough that Chinese dignitaries we host have made repeated requests to dine here. (An alternate menu is available for Chinese readers.)\n\nBest Chinese Restaurant in Northeast Ohio?  Hunan Solon is without doubt a prime contender for that title.", "date": "2010-11-06 18:51:38"}

The menu options are somewhat limited, but it's to be expected. It would be nice to have slightly more flexibility, such as making your own combo of meats, etc. But since it was my first time, I wanted to try almost everything, so I did by ordering the Ohio City Platter. In retrospect, I should have gone whole hog and gotten the Ultimate because then I could have also tried the sausage. Next time.\nThe Ohio City Platter comes with pulled pork, beef brisket, and ribs, baked beans, cornbread, and your choice of macaroni salad or cole slaw - I went slaw. The meats are extremely tender and good quality. I chose sauce on and it was sweet and tasty. The ribs were great, but the bark is real - word to the wise with any dental work/concerns, as I chose to pick and tear versus sinking my teeth in.  The portion are huge - I had a ton of leftovers - enough for 2-3 additional meals.\nI'd have to agree with other reviewers who said that what is keeping this place from being spectacular is the sides. I appreciated the sweeter take on cornbread, but it was most likely a box mix. The slaw was basic, also not homemade (I fancy myself a slaw connoisseur). The baked beans were okay - my companion immediately identified them as Bush's, and I don't doubt that they are also not house-made.  The sides are the reason for the 3-star rating. Beverages are all prepackaged from what I recall. House lemonade or iced tea would be a nice option.\nBUT, I truly cannot say how attentive and friendly the staff is! Seriously awesome and lovely. The decor is also great - kinda dark, but in a good way. \nTons of photos and info, which I liked - nothing wrong with getting your BBQ on and gathering some knowledge at the same time.\nThey are located right next to The Grocery and we didn't have any trouble finding parking on one of the side streets.", "date": "2018-04-23 16:54:21"}

I'm from LA and wanted to get away from The Strip. My friend recommended this local spot and it definitely hit the spot. It was really busy.  Kind of strange that there are no pagers/buzzers for this place, but the Hostess said she would come find us at the bar area.  I was skeptical, but okay.\n\nStarted the evening with a pitcher of white sangria. YUM! It could have had more fruit, but it was refreshing nonetheless.  About 30 minutes later and 2 couples who got there after us were seated before us, I asked the hostess how much longer it would be. It was clear that she forgot. Intuition correct! As a result, minus 1 star.\n\nDelicious: The bacon wrapped dates are great, as well as, the apple manchanga salad. However, I would do the salad at the end of the service, instead of the beginning. It's a great palate cleanser. Only okay: The lamb skewers with lentils were good but the lamb was a bit charred. The eggplant cannoli was also good but the goat cheese overpowered the dish. Beef empanada was okay. YUM: Dessert: banana nutella sandwhich and pistachio gelato. All that for under $40. Great pricing. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out.", "date": "2013-04-28 23:21:48"}

We finally got to our room, without much customer service from the girl at the front desk I might add. The room was nice and clean. Because of the long wait, we only had about 45 minutes down at the pool before they closed for the day. We were walking back to our room from the pool area, in a few doors down from our room was an extremely strong smell of marijuana. We got in our room hung out for a few minutes, went out on our balcony... And there was the smell again! We called down to the lobby to complain about the smell of pot stating that we had children here, and did not need them hi on our vacation and to please look into it.  They never followed up with us nor did we see any staff come around our room. We only stayed one night at the resort, so can only say how things went on this day. I can tell you that at checkout, that was another 40 minute Excursion. I don't know why the lines run the way they do, but they really need to get to handle on things.

I contacted Camelback Kia yesterday regarding an advertised car, a 2014 Kia Soul.  I have had contact with 4 salesmen so far.  Once they got my number, they seemed to swarm in like pirhanas.  One salesman, Mike Kimbrell, sent me an email confirming the \"ePrice\", which was the stated advertised price.  Salesman Blake Walker called me and talked in circles when I asked about the $3819 discount.  Another salesman named Ron K. called and left a general voicemail, but I haven't spoken with him.  I then texted Mike, since I wanted to clarify if there really WAS a car for the advertised price.  I got a rather rude text back.  He responded as if I were interrupting him.  I told him never mind, I'll contact someone else.  A little while later, another salesman named Robert called me.  After asking him pointed questions, he did acknowledge that the \"discount\" is only a discount if you qualify for THREE different incentives, such as, being a recent college graduate (nope, 20 years ago doesn't count ;) military service, and some type of financing discount (IF you're applying for a loan.)  I don't qualify for any of those incentives.  The advertised \"discount\" is the combined total of all the possible discounts.  I think that Camelback Kia is a very crooked business.  I would suggest that you look elsewhere for your new vehicle, if you can find a dealer that is actually truthful with their advertised prices and discounts.", "date": "2014-11-09 07:57:12"}

I used a my vegas reward for this and got a buy one get one deal for the premiere tickets but I am so mad I didn't read these terrible reviews first.\n\nBiggest waste of time.  The tricks he did were the same old tricks and he didn't try to show different types of illusion.\n\nNot Cirque du Soleil at all so not sure why it is advertised as such.\n\nJust don't go...", "date": "2015-08-07 07:37:01"}

You get a lot of protein in the medium bowl and the toppings is AMAZING. This place is my all time favorite place to go for all my poke needs. The drive is a bit far from my house but it's so worth it. They have a big bar and you can pick and choose what you want in your bowls. Typically i get half and half but i got a full rice bowl here. This is my fave hawaiian poke joint!! They also have so many amazing toppings that other places don't offer as well. The place is fairly big and is always clean!

Fifteen minutes after dropping Sasha off, I received a frantic call from Jaime that Sasha was hurt in the kennel. He was biting on the kennel bars and his mouth got stuck.  She took him over to Banfield and I need to come get him.  Of course, I turned around and went back to the store and straight back to Banfield, only to find out that they put Sasha in a kennel.  I asked for him to be brought to me immediately and called my own vet, who said he will keep the office open until I got there (about 545pm).  My vet said that Sasha was traumatized, he examined him and gave him a shot to calm him down.  To shorten this, Sasha lost a tooth and he has scrape marks on his side that I cannot account for with the story I was told.\n\nSasha has been in kennels all his life, my vet agrees with me, that something had to happen that made Sasha react that way, but no one at Petsmart is talking.

He was accommodating to my schedule, walked me through the whole process, showed me tons of options, and answered all questions I had.

I've been taking my teenage twin boys here for 3 years, since we moved to AZ. The particular barber being dissed here has worked there since we've been coming every 6 weeks or so. That guy is nicest of them all and practically lives there. I don't think he cares at all if someone who usually sees him sees another barber if the place is packed or people are waiting for him. He ALWAYS has a line of people waiting for him specifically and I think he understands when people aren't willing to wait an hour for a haircut. \n\nThe only thing remotely close to being a downside here is the older lady that doesn't speak very good language. If you get her it's very hard to communicate with her. Usually one of the barbers have to tell her in Spanish what is being said. She does good work though. \n\nI only came on here to check and see what time they opened today and stumbled upon the bad reviews so I had to speak up and post to save the reputation of a good person at the establishment.", "date": "2015-06-12 16:03:40"}

We had a coupon for $6.99 lunch that was good for up to four people. They open at 11am Mon-Sat and it was only 11:15am when we got inside. When we started going down the salad bar, I couldn't help but notice that everything looked like it was just uncovered from the night before. A lot of the salad was limp and majority of the toppings were almost empty. Considering they just opened 15 minutes before, it shouldn't have looked like that at all. In fact, one would think we would be getting the best of everything because it should all be newly stocked. That just wasn't the case here...\n\nWe looked at the menu online beforehand to make sure they had soups that we would like. The main reason why I wanted to go was for the Cream of Broccoli and Sweet Tomato Onion, so after eating some salad I went to load up on soup. I saw French Onion, chili, Cream of Broccoli, Turkey Noodle, Dill Potato, and Split pea. What was missing? The Sweet Tomato Onion!! Apparently they just don't follow their menu that's posted online because the Tomato Onion and Chicken Noodle were missing, but they had Dill Potato and French Onion, which weren't even on their online menu.\n\nThe only thing I really liked about my experience here the other day was that it was easy to find booth seating right next to the soup/pasta section because it was very early on a weekday, but that's not enough of a bonus to add another star.", "date": "2012-01-14 22:45:21"}

We also enjoyed the facts about the groups and the songs that were up on the back screen. Awesome experience!", "date": "2014-03-31 23:34:44"}

Ok, ok, I didn't \"need\" a facial, but I sure wanted one and I didn't want to spend a bunch of cash. Enter Aveda Institute. It's right around the corner from me, conveniently located in the north end of South End! This particular cosmetology school offers a whole variety of spa treatments from hair, to skincare, to waxing, etc. After chatting with the very since receptionist about their facial types, I chose the 60 minute Tourmaline Facial, priced at $45. (which is an absolute steal)\n\nAmanda was my esthetician and she was absolutely wonderful. The whole process took roughly 1.5 hours (exactly what the receptionist claimed on the phone) and I was so happy with the experience. Amanda took me through a bunch of different questions in the beginning to determine my personality, goals of the facial and scents to go along with it. It was super relaxing and my skin is quite happy with me. This particular facial focuses on exfoliating and re-engergizing the skin. While Amanda offered to do extractions if needed, I chose not to. For $45 this is an amazing facial, I highly, highly recommend it!\n\nNote to those who want to score some amazing and affordable Aveda services here:\n\n1) Call ahead. If you work a traditional 9-5 job and you need a Saturday appointment, expect to wait at least 2-3 weeks for an available time slot.\n\n2) Be patient and kind. These men and women are students at the school. While you are paying for their services, keep in mind that they are still learning and you will likely have to give your input to their instructors afterwards. \n\n3) Block out some serious time, especially for hair treatments. At a previous visit it took almost four hours from start to finish for a partial highlight. This as no fault of the student's, it just took a long time to flag down an instructor for the various parts of the service.", "date": "2010-07-27 16:38:43"}

I really wanted to eat a steak for my birthday and watch a early 7:00 pm show . The majority of the Steak houses in Vegas are open at 5:30 pm which wouldn't have worked for me but luckily Smith & Wollensky opens at 11am. \n\nMy husband and I started off with drinks to enjoy before the meal. I ordered a Skinny Mint . It tastes like Chocolate Mint candy but it was a little strong for me. The waiter was nice enough to ask me if I liked my drink because it looked like it hasn't been touched. He was willing to get me another one but I just explained that I did like it it's just that I am a sipper. My husband helped me finish it towards the end of the meal because I couldn't do it by myself. I was already feeling warm and making up my own phrases...I was a little tipsy. The drinks were $14.95 so my husband made sure we finished most of it. \n\nI had the Rib Eye Steak with Truffled Mac and Cheese. I really wanted their Lobster Mashed Potatoes but they stopped serving it because it's a seasonal item. I wasn't sure how I'd feel eating Mac and Cheese with my steak but it was melt in your mouth delicious! The steak was nice and juicy which I love because there is nothing worse then a dry, tough steak. We also had the Wollensky salad that had a type of Dijon dressing, real bacon and potato croutons. That was also really good. \n\nWe ended the meal with coffee, tea and my complimentary Birthday dessert . The presentation was cute and it consisted of a chocolate walnut brownie which is one of my favorites. Who am I kidding anything chocolate is my favorite!", "date": "2010-11-18 04:21:46"}

I've seen nearly every Cirque that passed through LA since I was a child, and I've seen most of the LV shows that never made it to LA.  I've loved some, liked most, and never really actually hated any, until I was given Elvis tix, which I thought, without a doubt, that I would despise.  However, I took the offer anyway, since I wasn't going to pass up on front-row seats (and I'm glad I didn't!).  Just for the record, my all-time fav is Alegria, hands down.\n\nNow, onto the review.  We watched it on Thursday night, the 9:30 show, and it was pretty full.  We were seated dead-center, just three rows back, all thanks to whatever wonderful comp deal I got.  The show started a little later that I thought, but the 'showgirls' were running around making conversation, chatting up some of the kids, which I thought was pretty neat.\n\nTo be clear, there is no Elvis impersonator.  At least, not like one main guy the whole way through.  But, personally, I liked it better like that.  It's like watching any other Cirque show, where you get to focus on everyone/everything that's going on, not just one person.  I liked the set, I liked most of the songs/dances.  There were a couple that I thought they either could have done without, but considering I'm not a huge Elvis fan (and the BF could have cared less), we both really truly enjoyed it.  I sang along to almost every song, and seemed to have liked it better than the actual Elvis mom's to my left.\n\nOverall, if you have free tix, don't pass them up!  If you have to pay, don't pay for the front row seats, lol.  I wouldn't have paid that much.  But for $FREE, go for it - reserve early so you can get your own kick-butt seats!", "date": "2011-04-14 02:10:42"}

I went to NYC for the first time last year and ate at some of the Halal carts there and their gyros were unlike any gyro I've ever had. I never visited THE Halal Guys and had heard they were the best of the best. When I heard they were opening a location here I freaked out, I couldn't wait!\n\nWe went last night around 9 pm, it wasn't that busy. I mean it was full and there was a line but I was expecting it to be outside wrapped around the building. In all it only took about five minutes from the time we walked in until we left with our order.\n\nI ordered the chicken and gyro combo plate with the white and red sauces on the side. I tasted the white sauce before I put it on my food thankfully because it's revolting. I assumed it would be like a tzatziki but it was basically liquid mayo. I ended up adding half the packet of the red sauce which gave it a nice heat. Unfortunately the hot sauce was the only great thing about this meal.\n\nThe gyro meat was more like ground lamb than sliced gyro meat like how I had it in New York, and the meat itself was very tasteless. The chicken was ok, it wasn't dry, but again it was lacking in flavor. The rice was extremely bland as well, all the food pretty much tasted like red sauce and had no flavor of its own.\n\nIt wasn't a terrible meal it was just extremely underwhelming and disappointment. The Halal Guys came very hyped by everyone and unfortunately the dish did not come close to delivering.

They did a good job wiping down the dash and console; while half-assing the doors and the vacuum job. I wasn't too bummed; but, if you skip steps you don't get a tip, their loss. Had I paid for a service that included a more extensive detail, I'd have made them re-do those parts. At the end of the day, It's a mediocre carwash. Where you get exactly what you pay for. I got what I expected when I left, and I'll probably be back.", "date": "2016-05-09 22:01:12"}

The bun was flat too.\n-The fries looked like they were handcut, which I appreciate.  But they came out pretty oily and weren't seasoned.  Couldn't taste any salt.\n- The baked potato came out warmed but not steamy hot.  They might be pre-cooking these and then re-heating for convenience.  It just was average.   If you call yourself Tater's, make sure your baked potato is the best.  \n- You can hear everything the wait staff is saying.   \n\nPositives:\n- They had some interesting takes on burgers that if executed well would be a reason to come here.\n- Our servers were friendly and swift", "date": "2013-03-23 14:53:53"}

NO!\n\nSo we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.\n\nDoor guy says, NO!\n\nI say, \"You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in.\" (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)\n\nDoor guy says, \"fine you can come in, but that one stays out!\" (pointing to my friend)\n\nI say, \"Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate.\"\n\nApparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...\n\nHe then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?\n\nApparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.\n\n\"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?\"\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Umm\"\n\n\"Yo!\"\n\nRetard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who \"got in\" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. \n\nI then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.\n\nSo if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.", "date": "2006-10-07 18:54:46"}

We were only there for a night but these suite-style perks were pretty cool. My one minor complaint about the room is a lack of a side table by the beds.

I loved the way they opened and closed the curtains. It was so unique. The water adds an extremely creative dimension of awe. The water wasn't gimmicky at all. It was utilized in different ways for different effects throughout the entirety of the show. It was thrilling to see the performers in different depths of water. I felt this show carried a lot of symbolism in different aspects. I read into the characters and scenes. Though there wasn't an overall obvious story, I still identified the mini stories and understood the tie between the beginning and end. A lot of that was lost on my boyfriend, so he did not enjoy the show at all. Some of the characters played a small roll, but I enjoyed them so much that I wish they had been incorporated more. For this show, Cirque emphasized the \"things are not always what they seem\" theme of a circus. That was a bit cheesy for me, but my boyfriend hated it. There were a few flat parts, especially the contortionists. That part seems to be too long without anything else going on. I would have preferred for that act to be cut in half and to see more of different performers. Other than that, it was truly an artistic performance. The water is an amazing concept that was incorporated and executed perfectly. It was way more than I expected.\n\nIt should be noted that my boyfriend would probably rate this show a 1 or 2. He has seen \"Love\" 3 times and even cried during it. He said this did not compare to Love at all and preferred any other Cirque show he's seen to this one. He said it was just too boring. Obviously, I disagree entirely but I felt his comments should be incorporated in case there is anyone who is on the fence and would like a different opinion among the sea of 5-stars here.", "date": "2014-07-10 23:49:08"}

I've also had the fish sandwich and a salad here, and they were just as high quality and wonderful as their burgers and fries. Shakes are good here, too. They have a very small space, so expect to wait unless you want to sit at the communal table or outside (in which case you still might wait). However, it's a very nice atmosphere, with casual vibe and good music. I only deduct a point because service was so-so on my last visit, and the restaurant smelled like a nursing home for some reason.", "date": "2009-05-18 07:21:49"}

Does wonders for the sushi (apply to nearly all sushi joints)\n- If you get take out, check if the order is correct, if they miss something and you call in, you are most likely going to be made to feel like its your mistake (the last time this happened I did not go there for over 6 month)", "date": "2013-02-13 01:31:07"}

The ferris wheel had the typical asian snacks like fries, popcorn chicken, wings, etc. I felt like the bbq eel dish came with too much rice but for $20 total (ferris wheel split between 3 people) it wasn't too bad. \n\nMy main complaint is with the attitude that one of the waitresses gave my friend. She tipped $1 because she didn't know 10% was the normal amount and the waitress was super aggressive about it. She told us that if customers don't tip at least 10% then she would have to pay 10% of our bill back to the restaurant owners out of pocket. I told her I'm pretty sure that's illegal (especially since tipping is OPTIONAL) and she said \"that sucks\" and muttered something under her breath about having student loans to pay off... join the club lol. Sorry but I think harassing customers for tips is very inappropriate and frankly it's pretty rude. The waitress was really nice and made polite conversation with us at the beginning, but as soon as one of us didn't tip 10% suddenly the niceties went away hahaha. \n\nAnyways I just want to end by saying I know the waitress isn't fully to blame here; if the management really is deducting 10% from the staff's cheques if they don't get tipped that's the biggest issue here. It would be nice if the staff could be mature enough to not take their frustration out on the customers (who also have student debts too...).

Throughout our entire meal, I was being bumped into by wait staff inputting orders. Staff also used the narrow space to walk to the patio (instead of using the designated door).

The fries didn't appear to be shaken in the basket prior to delivery. They were almost inedible. My husband had the same issue with his chickpea sandwich. \n3.

Which meant I was drinking caffeine to try to stay awake, and it all cascaded to affect my overall health.\n\nI was expecting, you know, massive weights and running 'til I puked.

And I'm not a skinny person, mainly because if you read my other Yelp reviews you'll see they're all about drinking and desserts, and honestly, I've cut that down but to be truly ripped I'd have to give all that up.  \n\nBut my back doesn't hurt on long airline flights.  I sleep well, for eight hours.  My body has strength in places I never knew it could have strength before. \n\nAnd now, when I look in the mirror, I see how I was standing wrong.  I see all the ways Fitness Evolution adjusted me, one session at a time, to give me better flexibility and health.  \n\nThey helped me.  It ain't cheap.

Therefore, cupcakes are the perfect dessert for me. \n\nVenturing around town one night, my boyfriend and I came across Fuddruckers and ate ourselves silly. Then we went next door and saw there was a cupcake place and decided to cupcake ourselves silly since we were already here and we live at least 20 miles away.  We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Mad Hatter Cupcakes is like the equivalent to those \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books I read as a kid. As someone of non-discriminating taste to a point where it drives my boyfriend nuts when I can't make a simple decision about food, this place was like decision overload for me.  First you choose your flavor cake, then flavor filling, then flavor of icing and how about a topping? Then rinse and repeat until you've ordered what you want to order. We've returned several times, and it seems that each time I walk in, I completely freeze and panic, and blurt out the weirdest combinations of cupcakes. Lemon cake with strawberry filling and... peanut butter icing?? D'oh. \n\nSurprisingly however, they always taste fantastic. Even in my panic-stricken flavor combinations, the cupcakes are always great. I know there's some subjection as to whether some people like their cake a little cripsy on the outside, or if crispy is a sin in the baking world, but I actually like the little bit of crunch you get from the top of the cake as you bite into it.  I'm assuming the cupcakes do this because they're left un-iced for some time due to the Mad Hatter setup, but if this may not be kosher in the baking world, it's definitely okay with me. \n\nThe only thing I'd suggest for improvement is if they added a \"cupcake of the week/month\" flavor just so that their selection of choices doesn't get redundant. Maybe throw in a nutella icing?? Or perhaps a marble cake? Just something I'd like to see, but that's me and my curious non-discriminatory nature. Or something.", "date": "2010-03-29 00:57:59"}

As parents of a third grader, it's not often we get to go out for meals that don't involve a kid's menu that comes with crayons or sing their own loud renditions of \"Happy Birthday\", so knowing we were going out for \"a nice meal\" was definitely a welcomed change of pace.\n\nFirst of all, the only real bummer in all of this and the reason for four stars instead of five, was that they lost my reservation.  Of all the things I forgot to pack, it was the piece of paper with the confirmation number on it.  They managed to seat us fairly quickly, but it was certainly after all of the other walk-ins had been seated.  I'll remember next time to bring my confirmation.\n\nThe decor was definitely not current Vegas glitz, but that doesn't mean it's bad.  It was clean and classic - true \"old\" Vegas, but not in a tired and dated, \"OMG I CAN SEE THROUGH THAT CARPET\" kind of way.  Personally, I enjoyed it.  If you're not into anything except glitter and shiny lights, this might not be for you.\n\nThe service was amazing.  Our waiter and the rest of the staff were on par with their suggestions and we never wanted for much.  For starters, my husband had the lobster bisque and I had a Caesar salad - although you can get a Caesar salad just about anywhere, this one was by far the best I've had in a long time.  My husband couldn't stop raving about the bisque and, had we been at one of those paper kid's menu places, he might've licked the bowl clean.\n\nFor entrees, we skipped the steaks and had their pasta dishes.  I had the spaghetti carbonara - ironically, it was the cheapest item on the menu at $28, but I wasn't choosing it to be cheap.  I chose it because I really like carbonara and my low-carb diet was on hold for our trip to Vegas, so I was shoveling all the pasta into my gut that I could manage.  I wasn't let down, either - the noodles tasted like they'd been made in house, the sauce was perfectly creamy and OMG THE BACON.  Quite possibly, the best bacon I've ever had in all my 33 years.\n\nMy husband had some linguine dish.  It had shrimp the size of his fist.  Beyond that, I don't remember.  I was too busy having a bacon-related orgasm.  He enjoyed his dish as well and again, I think I saw him really contemplating licking the plate clean.\n\nI could not finish my meal and my husband was equally stuffed, so we skipped dessert and chose instead to finish our drinks and enjoy each other's company.  The only thing that seemed out of place in the entire establishment was a loud wedding party seated behind us.  It kind of ruined the mojo a little bit, but that wasn't the establishment's fault.\n\nAll in all, this place is ace in my book.  A perfect example of how a Groupon can help you drum up repeat business - we'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.", "date": "2012-10-01 09:51:45"}

If you are traveling through, you definitely have stop here, at least for the novelty factor. Overall, food is good for a... well, for a sandwich shop... But in the end, I didn't leave with a sense that I really had to come back. \n\nThe real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... \"who cares\".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \n\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich. In the end, Primanti Brothers is a definite must try if you are passing through, but I don't see myself craving these babies any time soon.", "date": "2012-07-07 18:58:53"}

So of course, I was beyond excited to hear that an aquarium was opening up in town!  The $18 ticket price kept me away until yesterday, when I scored a Groupon for $9 per ticket!  I'm glad I waited, because I don't feel as though it's worth the normal price.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good aquarium.  I've definitely seen better, but those have been in large cities or close to the ocean.  It's very small (located inside a mall), but they did the best they could with the space they had.  There is one large tank, which you can view from at least four different locations.  I'm not a big fan of the \"line\" you have to stand in pretty much through the entire thing, since the path is fairly narrow, and winds around from area to area.  But overall, there was a good variety of animals, and lots of facts and information to make it a great educational experience.  The decor reminds me of Disneyland - very clean, and lots of attention to detail, which I definitely appreciate.  \n\nOne of my favorite things was the little scratch-off \"quiz card\" that you get when you enter.  There are eight questions to answer, and it helps keep younger kids entertained while waiting for the line to move along.  At the end, they can redeem their card for a sticker at the gift shop.  This is a great way to avoid buying overpriced, unnecessary souvenirs!\n\nWe spent about an hour and a half walking through the aquarium, stopping at each exhibit.  Some of our favorites were the tidepool creatures (touch tank), sharks and rays (viewable from above the tank as well as the side), and seahorses.  They also had a very cool octopus!  The aquarium has \"talks\" scheduled for every hour or so in different areas, and if we had decided to stay for one or two of those, we probably would have been there for longer.  At the end of the aquarium, there is a large room with a play structure.  I'm not sure why they need this, although our little guy sure enjoyed it!  I wish they had used that space for another exhibit!\n\nIt was a fun experience, and worth the $9 discounted tickets.

When they brought our orders to the table they waited a minute to make sure we had everything we needed. At the end of our meal someone came out to make sure we enjoyed everything. Great service!\n\nMy second Beach Hut Deli experience was a take-out order at work. Ordering for an office was also easy. The menu was easy to find on their website. I called in the six orders and the woman that took my order repeated everything back at the end for accuracy. All of the orders were correct when we picked them up. We were quoted 15-20 minutes to prepare our order and it was indeed ready when we arrived in that amount of time.\n\nThe menu is very unique with sandwich and sub options that you won't find at other delis. Regular size subs are 6\" and Large size subs are 9\". I was happy to see that they have a Dude/Duddette option which is 3\" for subs and half a sandwich for the gourmet sandwiches. The subs are all loaded with meat and toppings so for me a 3\" sub is plenty with a side. \n\nThe Hobie is their version of an Italian with salami, pastrami, provolone, and Italian dressing. It's loaded with meat and toppings for a delicious and filling sub. The Mahalo Taco (special) was one of the best subs I've ever tasted. It included taco seasoned roast beef and chips. Trying to describe the amazing flavor of this sub is impossible. The flavors all worked so well together. This sub was also packed with meat and toppings. The High Tide has pastrami, ham, bacon, pepper jack cheese, and thousand island dressing on cheese bread. It was very tasty, but I think the sub bread is better than the sandwich bread. The Potato Salad and Pasta Salad are both obviously made in house and are delicious. The Potato Salad has large pieces of potato with skin on and a delicious dressing.

Vomiting, diarrhea, high fever, sinus pressure, sore throat, headaches, stomach pains, my whole body ached, I could barely walk, very lethargic, and coughing to the point where my rib cage hurts. I was hoping to be seen just for the symptoms I was having but instead the PA took it upon herself and thought since I have Celiac disease that it could be something going on inside my stomach causing the infection because I  had such a high fever. She did not give me the proper check up that was required for someone coming in for being sick. She did not listen to my lungs and I have asthma so you could hear rails as I breathed but she didn't check or ask, I even wrote it on my paperwork. Nor did she give my throat a proper exam because I knew I was having throat pain, as noted in my paperwork, but she said she didn't see any redness. Basically she was calling me a liar. So her recommendation was for me to go straight to the emergency room. She did not release me with any medication whatsoever and I even had a fever of 100. I was in dire pain but again this doctor released me, their patient, without the proper care I needed. My insurance is a little different, I would have to pay $2000 just to go to the emergency room and the PA did not care. Of course I couldn't go to the emergency room so I was in pain with no sleep for the entire night until the next day when I went to another urgent care extra. At this urgent care extra, I wasn't given the proper treatment nor the proper medications. Especially the proper medications!! I was given generic cough syrup that my insurance did not cover and ended up being $40. The pharmacist also informed me that this prescription is the same as Robitussin. So I basically paid $40 for Robitussin. Thank you very much PA! All of these urgent care extras are a joke. They will not prescribe medications that are NEEDED for one to feel better, not even a simple antibiotic for someone that is extremely sick with the flu. This is the second facility with this same name that has encouraged me to go to the emergency room to get treatment. It seems to me as though they do not want to treat their patients. They get rid of them by sending them to the emergency rooms instead of fixing them. That's how these emergency rooms get over crowded because PAs and Doctors don't want to treat certain patients and will send them straight to the emergency room. Shame on you! They also took my urine sample which I didn't mind. I know I'm clean and I do not do drugs so therefore they should prescribe me the medicine I need to feel better, to go back to work, to take care of my children, and to get rid of this flu that I have. Now I have to make another appointment with a different doctors office for a flu that has kept me away from work for a week!

I had a rough night tending to my dog wheezy who is fairly old and having trouble with her pregnancy. These people straight up told me and my family that wheezy would die if she gave birth naturally. So they told us the only option of a C section. They brought us a quote of how much it would be, $3,800 dollars!!! Plus the initial fee for being seen that day! While me and my family are racking our brains to find out how we're going to pay this to save wheezies life, the staff kept coming in the room bothering us if we've made up our minds because \"we don't have much time left for wheezy\" so after 6 people in my family applied for credit care and all got denied they gave us another option to get a title loan so we drive to the title loan center and find out we can't because we're from florida and just moved here a week ago and have to have proof of residency. So we get back to the hospital thinking wheezy is going to die cause the staff told us she doesn't have much time left. Then when they found out  we couldn't pay the money they gave us our bill and sent us on our way with a card of another animal clinic, they told us the only way to save wheezy was to abort her babies. They staff told us that the card of the other animal clinic will do this for us but they don't open until 7am. It was already 3am so we just all went home with wheezy and stayed up and got to the other animal clinic at 6:15am. They showed up at 7 and tell them whats going on and they tell us they have no idea why they referred us to them because they don't do those kinds of surgery!!!!! This company only wants MONEY!! They don't care what happens to you or your pet! My story has a happy ending though! Finally after hours of no sleep and searching we found an amazing Animal Clinic on 400 college Dr. Its called black mountain! They took wheezy in with extraordinary care and let us stay with her! They also worked with us on payment, they allowed us to pay in payments instead of all upfront and wheezy had her c section for only $1,600! Now we have 5 new baby boy puppies in the family and wheezy is struggling a little but they are keeping her there with them and giving her all the care she needs! When we picked up the puppies black mountain went through the steps of how to take care of them and the supplies we need! If you want great care and great prices BLACK MOUNTAIN ON 400 COLLEGE DR.!

It is an inviting open restaurant with a large bar area and dark wood furnishings all around.  \n\nWe arrived before our other guests and sat down for a pre-dinner drink at the bar.  We had boulevardier ($17) and a maitresse ($13).  The brasserie's version of the boulevardier is a mixture of Bulleit rye whiskey instead of bourbon, Aperol instead of Campari and sweet vermouth with a slice of orange rind.  It was a really good pour with no ice to mask the taste and the heavy cut crystal glass it was served in was a nice touch.  The maitresse, served in a martini glass, was a sweet concoction of rum, lime and coconut liqueur that perhaps would make a good drink if you were sitting by the pool but it didn't work well before dinner.\n\nWhen the rest of the group arrived, we started with the Terrine of foie gras ($24), burrata ($14), and the crab timbale ($20).  All three tasted ok but the delicate crab flavor was overwhelmed by the taste of the overlying fruit and the foie gras terrine didn't have the punch or flavor of the seared version that you could get upstairs at Bouchon.\n\nFor dinner we has the Tunisian lamb with merguez sausage ($45), the sea scallops ($29), the oven roasted halibut ($40) and the swordfish ($42).  The scallops had a good sear on them and were served on a bed of sweet corn and shitake mushrooms.  They were delicious. The halibut was also cooked just right and was moist and flavorful. On the other hand, the swordfish was on the dry side and kind of bland.  Perhaps they had two different chefs cooking the fish that night?  The lamb and spicy sausage tasted fine on its own but seemed heavy in comparison to the first two seafood dishes.\n\nFor desert, the standout of the night was the grand marnier souffl\u00e9 with vanilla anglaise sauce ($15). I don't know how he got it to be so light and airy or how it came out so fast but it was one of the best I have ever had. Roy Yamaguchi could learn a thing or two about cooking souffl\u00e9's from this place. We also split the pistachio-cherry Sunday ($14). This tasted great while you were eating the overlying flavorful pistachio ice cream but it lost its charm when you got down to the sour cherry ice cream underneath.\n\nOverall, it was a good dining experience. The place was kind of empty for dinner time on a Saturday night but perhaps that is because it is still new. I also notice with trepidation that some of the dish prices at the restaurant are already a dollar or two higher than what is advertised on the online menu. As it is still kind of early to be raising prices, I hope it doesn't mean the new restaurant is already in trouble.  I would recommend it and I know I would go back, especially for more souffl\u00e9.", "date": "2014-07-13 22:01:15"}

As I spoke to Dean, I found out they also do plumbing.  Wow, an honest a/c business and plumbing too, Jackpot (sorry bad Vegas pun)!   So happy that someone is actually being honest with me.

The chicken strips are on par with frozen Tyson strips, as in mechanically separated chicken formed into the shape of the tenderloin of a chicken, and covered in a ton of cajun seasoning.

A group of friends and I went around 11pm on a Friday night and the place was decently busy, but not so crowded that we couldn't snag seats at the bar. I immediately noticed that the clientele at Acacia was VERY diverse. One guy was wearing pajama pants (literally), while others were wearing suits and bow ties. The drink menu was decent, with many different beer, wine and cocktail options to choose from, but at premium prices. Because Acacia is the type of place to go for a well-made cocktail, I ordered a tequila-based one that sounded good. I was disappointed that most of the cocktails were whisky or gin heavy since I am more of a vodka/tequila drinker. It took quite a while for the bartender to come over to take my group's order (we were sitting at the bar) and it was about ten minutes after that before I got my drink. I know cocktails take longer to make, but I was watching the bartender and he was just essentially twiddling his thumbs instead of making our drinks. Once I finally got it, I was impressed with the cocktail-- the flavors were balanced nicely and it had just the right amount of 'kick'. \n\nEven though I wasn't having a super good time, I was down to have one more drink before moving on to somewhere else and spent 20 minutes trying to order another drink by doing that awkward stare at the bartender (My group was still sitting at the bar and we all had empty drinks). After witnessing the bartender (a different guy than the original one who served me) speak rudely to other customers (statements such as 'Don't you know it is rude to close your tab then order another drink fifteen minutes later?'), it became clear that Acacia is full of pretentious staff members who think they are doing you a favor by serving you. I was fed up with the terrible service and generally obnoxious atmosphere and decided that despite wanting another cocktail that I would settle for beer at a bar down the road.

So good...\" I'm not sure if there are different staff on the days some of these bad reviews were written, but I'm shocked to read that some people actually feel the food is \"inedible\". The same thing with the service (which was also exceptional). They're probably the people who complain about everything and nothing is ever good enough for them - we all have one of those relatives. I will say that when compared to other higher quality restaurants, it is still priced about 25 to 30 percent higher than it needs to be, but then again so is everything else in Vegas. At least with food this good, you're not kicking yourself afterward. You pay $50 for a buffet of just regular food, you tend to be grumpy or even regretful. You pay $50 for a steak that is mind blowing, and suddenly it's not that bad. Especially when the staff are SOOOO friendly and totally go above and beyond. I never had to look for our server once! He was all over it, every step of the meal. He sensed my son was struggling with the menu and came over to explain what things were. My son was almost finished with his soda and our server was at the table with a refill before my son took his last sip. My son actually said \"woah!\" I've never seen a server anticipate every need of a diner before, quite impressive.  It was an excellent experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and will go again when back in town.", "date": "2017-12-06 00:43:53"}

A boy came in with his father. He seemed nervous. But the staff greeted him so warmly and by name, so I realized he was a regular customer.

His father sat back in a chair next to him as the stylists worked to make the boy feel comfortable, safe and loved. They sought consent from him, they were affectionate and incredibly patient as he squirmed around.

That sounded like a good deal and I was due for a cleaning, so I made an appointment.  Upon entering the office, I was taken promptly to my exam area.  A staff member proceeded to take x-rays and pictures.  She seemed completely inexperienced.  The X-rays hurt quite bad, and I have never experienced pain from x rays before.  She then took high definition pictures of my teeth, and placed a monitor right in front of my face so that I could see the pictures.  As a I later realized, that was likely a marketing technique.  My teeth (and yours also most likely) do not look pretty that close up, and those images would provide an opportunity for Dr. Abedi to \"improve\" my smile.  \n\nSo, after shes done taking the pictures and x-rays, Dr. Abedi comes in.  He spend maybe 5-10 minutes examining my teeth.  He then says they cannot do a cleaning because I need a deep cleaning in my entire mouth.  He said he will give me a \"discount\" of 20% (what kind of dentist gives discounts?) so that the deep cleaning will \"only\" cost about $900.  I tell him that I want a normal cleaning in accordance with the coupon, but he says that the hygienist is out of the office (why the hell would you schedule an appointment for an exam, x rays, and cleaning when the hygienist is out of the office?).  \n\nRemarkably, he then also claims that I have extremely receding gums and that I NEED about 15 gum grafts, and that, because I do not have insurance, he will lower the cost of EACH GRAFT from $1200 to $980.  So, yes, within 10 minutes of meeting me, he claimed that I needed approximately $15,000 in dental work.  \n\nI was aware I had some gum recession, but had seen many other periodontists and dentists and believed that the recession was not as serious as this Doctor Abedi made it sound.  I made another appointment at a nearby dentist, Avalon Dentistry (I highly recommend them).  Dr. Peifer examined me and told me that I have some recession but am not at any risk of losing functional value of the teeth and that I only need a basic (not deep) cleaning every 6 months.  His office then set me up with a cleaning the very next day, and charged me only $100 for the exam and cleaning, saving me, in essence, $14,900.", "date": "2017-04-13 22:04:31"}

I also found Carefree Moving online and read some reviews before making up my mind. They moved me yesterday (Aug 28) without any issues whatsoever.\n\n2 guys arrived at 4pm as promised. I signed the contract and they promptly started loading stuff into the truck after doing the initial inspection to determine the quantity of stuff and what needs to go first in the truck. The guys spoke Russian and because I also speak Russian, there was zero language barrier for me personally. I can't vouch for their English language skills, so your experience might be different than mine. They had plenty of blankets in which they wrapped a painting, a glass table and a mirror. The move from 1 bedroom to another 1 bedroom within a 2KM radius took 2 hours and 30 minutes. They offer a very competitive rate of $55/hour and they charge a fixed $95 fee for transportation, meaning you pay for the time and gas they spend to get to your place and from your place back to the office/warehouse. So, I was charged $55 x 2.5 + $95 (fixed transportation fee). The guys had a spacious truck, no more than 5 years old.\n\nMost other moving companies either have a 4-hour minimum at $70+/hr or charge a lot per hour. These guys are priced very competitively with no minimums. Most other companies I called (and I called over 10 companies in Toronto) were quoting me anywhere from $250 to $600 for just 2 hours of work, due to 3-4 hour minimums, compounded by rather high initial fixed fees that cover transportation expenses.\n\nI cannot guarantee that your experience will be smooth. Some people are really picky, sometimes unreasonably so, but if you want people will do the job at a reasonable rate, Carefree Moving is a good option to consider.", "date": "2013-08-29 21:16:40"}

Never having tried \"modern American Mexican\" before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was quite favorably impressed with the flavors and preparation.\n\nBecause I'd heard so much about the tequila selection, CM and I started off by ordering the featured tequila sampler of the week--tres generaciones ($8)--which consisted of shots of blanco, reposado, and anejo tequilas, as well as sangria.  Despite that these were tequila shots, CM and I split them, and I'm glad that we did, given their strength!  Even the first one (blanco) was stronger than I expected, and CM felt quite tipsy after downing the remainder of the second one (reposado) after I took a sip.  While all of them were good, my favorite was the third (anejo), due to the complexity and depth of its flavor.  Even the sangria was delicious and well-balanced, making for a great palate cleanser.\n\nAs our appetizer, CM and I split an order of chips and salsa with the trio of salsas, which consisted of salsa roja, salsa verde, and pico de gallo ($8).  The red and green salsas were addictive, to the point that I kept munching on them throughout--and after--the meal.  While the pico was fresh, it wasn't as flavorful or complex as the other salsas, but it certainly wasn't bad, either.  The chips were quite good in their own right, too.  This would definitely make a great appetizer to munch on for people just coming for a drink, as well.\n\nFor our entree, CM and I split the family style tacos ($29), which comes with ingredients for six tacos. We chose pescado and carnitas as our proteins and a mix of corn and flour tortillas.  All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious, with a great blend of flavors.  I preferred the fish slightly due to its crisp exterior and light and flaky interior, but the carnitas were pretty good, as well.  I was also pleased with the veggies and beans and rice that came with it, which were cooked well.  The only thing that surprised me was that some of the usual accoutrements for tacos (cheese, sour cream, guac, salsa, etc.) were missing.  This wasn't too much of a problem, though, since the ingredients of the tacos stood on their own, and I was able to add some of the salsas that came with the chips to them.  The only thing that struck me as strange was the spiciness of my first taco, but this turned out to be my own fault, due to having added too much Tabasco sauce (my other tacos, which I didn't add Tabasco to, didn't have this problem!).\n\nMy only substantive criticism is that the service wasn't very attentive, esp. after our food was delivered.  Our waitress didn't come by for at least half an hour after that to ask how the food was or fill our waters.  Several more parties did come in around that time, so she was likely busy attending to them, but it certainly would have been nice not to have to refill my own water glass (luckily, the pitcher was located right next to our table).\n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with my (pre-) Valentine's Day meal at Verde.  Sure, it's not the most \"authentic\" Mexican food in PGH (if you're seeking authentic, I'd recommend Casa Reyna or La Palapa), but it's excellent fusion cuisine.  I'd definitely return for the delicious, creative food and classy atmosphere--and to try some of their other drinks, such as a margarita, my favorite tequila-based cocktail!", "date": "2015-02-15 04:58:51"}

I was convinced that having hair extensions would ruin my natural hair and worried that it would make my hair even thinner. I couldn't have been more wrong!\n\nFrom the beginning, Katy gave recommendations that fit my natural hair and made me assured that the extensions wouldn't cause any damage. She made adjustments that fit my needs and made sure that they weren't damaging my hair with too much weight from the extensions. I LOVED having long hair again after trying to grow my hair out for so long. And even more amazing is the fact that NO ONE knows I have extensions, when I tell them they literally never believe me!\n\nSince then, for the past two years, Cassie has always done my lifts and my trade-ins. I always have a blast going in to my appointments and catching up with her. She does an amazing job and always makes my hair look natural and stylish before I leave. She has even made adjustments for me in the summer when my hair gets lighter and needs some lighter extensions.

Second I felt like I was driving into a construction zone vs. a high end restaurant and it was difficult knowing exactly where to park, which turned out to be on the opposite side of the restaurant entrance. When we entered, no one was there to greet us other than an ominous odor that can only be described as cleaning fluid. We asked to be seated outside which was fine except for the numerous flies we had to contend with. Our waiter was very cordial and informative. We ordered an appetizer and entree. The appetizer and sides(salad etc. ) were fine but  entrees were not what I expected for the price we paid.  We had  to pay extra for the bourbon glaze on the steaks and salmon, really?  No stars for the atmosphere and food and only reason I give 2 stars was because of our waiter who was very cordial and nice. Might want to consider a dress code.

We were told we'd need to sit at the bar if we wanted to order food, and then the staff were all so busy prematurely breaking everything down to close up for the night that it took me forever to be able to ask someone to bring me silverware since my food was hastily set down in front of me without any silverware. It really kills the ambience when you're just wondering if you'll ever be able to get a fork or if you'll ever be able to order a drink despite that you're sitting at the bar all the while the manager is going around barking at everyone to get everything closed up. I've never been to a place that was so intent on having everything all pulled apart and cleaned up so the staff could leave at the same time as the diners, but the experience was rather unpleasant. I also got the sense that they must mostly deal with drunk jerks, because the attitude of the staff seemed relatively unfriendly and bizarrely condescending, apart from the one bartender guy who seemed to be trying. To be honest, based on my experience working in restaurants while I was in college, I got the impression that this place was hampered by poor management. That said, the service was similarly unfriendly at the Honolulu location so perhaps it's a corporate problem.\n\nI still gave the place 3 stars because the Gardein menu is wonderful, and the food was generally quite good.", "date": "2015-09-11 00:48:12"}

So I went here recently for an early dinner with my parents. This eatery is super cute and it's located in The Village by the Grange. It's an actual restaurant not one of the stalls in the food court.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly yet soft-spoken server. She brought us tea right away. All the staff here are really nice. We wanted to start off with the Takosen (3 for $2.99) but we were told they ran out of senbei so we essentially got 3 Takoyaki instead (they discounted us $0.50 for the missing senbei so we paid $2.49 for 3 pieces). They told us it would take 20 minutes to prepare the Takoyaki, so we actually got our meals first but that was OK. \n\nI ordered the Wakame Udon ($4.49), my dad had the Niku Udon ($5.99) and mom had the Yakatori Don ($10.99).\n\nMy Wakame Udon was OK but a bit plain. It had lots of Wakame seaweed in it, along with green onions and what looked like rice krispies. I chose the fish broth instead of the vegetable broth and it was flavorful but not too salty which I liked. The Udon was nicely cooked, not too mushy just the right consistently with the right amount of chewiness. I should have ordered the Udon with the fish cake or the fried egg because mine was too plain, but that was my fault for ordering it.\n\nI had some of the beef from my dad's Niku udon. It was tender and had a good flavour. His meal had plenty of beef in it. My mom said that my dad's beef broth was much tastier than my fish broth. I also had a skewer of my mom's yakatori. The chicken was good and had a slightly sweet taste to it. It was very tiny though. The amount of meat on each skewer was about the size of my thumb.  She got 4 tiny chicken skewers and a fried egg on top of a mound of seasoned rice with shredded nori seaweed sprinkled on top. Both my parents really enjoyed their meals. \n\nThe Takoyaki was the best part of the meal. The piece of octopus inside was tiny, literally smaller than my pinky nail. However the dough surrounding it was heavenly. It was airy and tasted so good. I wished we had ordered more pieces. They were topped with this delicious sauce and with bonito flakes. If you go here you should order the Takoyaki or Takosen.\n\nThe place is charming, the staff are nice, the food is good and the prices reasonable. What's not to like?", "date": "2015-05-16 01:06:18"}

There definitely wasn't \"sobremesa\" time. The wait staff was attentive, maybe overly so.

We arrived and the place was packed. There was a 5 to 10 minute wait, and we were super hungry. We sat down in 5 minutes! I didn't want to come here when the place opened and thought I'd give them some time to work out the new business kinks. I'm glad I did, cause looking at all the bad reviews and good ones had me very curious about this place. But anyway the service was really awesome, the girl asked all the right questions and took down our whole order... The only thing was she sold herself short a little bit by not following through with all the awesome questions she had... For instance my wife ordered the chicken Alfredo, she said it came with veggies and my wife said she would like them on the side. well, we never got them at all. The other thing is she asked if we wanted our salads before our food, and said yes! Definitely.... And of course our food came out with our salad, equaling our food to be cold after we ate our salad. Food was not hot! Probably the biggest complaint. It was slightly warm though, and atleast it was good... I warned the staff but I didn't want them to take my food. Was only trying to inform them. The garlic bread served with our food was only 1 little piece, and really soggy with butter, barely toasted, no crunch to it at all! I asked for more bread, and she brought me 1 more slice of sogginess.....oh well, me and my wife are extremely picky, and like lots of bread to go with our New Orleans pasta and chicken Alfredo. Honestly we really liked the food even though the little things didn't add up very nicely. We will come back! They are always super slammed so I could tell the waitress was overwhelmed and the kitchen staff wasn't working with her to really make the customers extremely happy. You can tell this place is going to have a lot of criticism, but I recommend trying it out and see if it's for you, maybe give it another month for things to slow down a little bit, but ultimately the food is good, service is good, decor is nice....

It was fine with a coat, but I wouldn't suggest it otherwise. I'm guessing in the summer they have misters.\n\nIt started off well.  Most of us got iced teas, and some of us ordered starters.  My partner and I got a half/half basket of sweet potato fries/garlic rosemary fries.  The garlic ones were good, as were the sweet potatoes ones, but they were a bit too sugary to start the meal out with.\n\nFrom there, the food stayed tasty, but the service went down hill.  It took a while for the extra ketchup to come out, and when it finally did, 3 main courses were brought out (for a table of 7).  Another seven minute later, 3 more courses came out.  People were polite, but after another five minutes, I told everyone to dig in. I desperately tried to find out server, but to no avail.  When I finally did (when the rest of the table was half way done -- she never even came back for a \"how is everything\" check to note that my veggie burger hadn't come out). When I finally caught her, she told me it was right there on the counter, and she just needed to grab it.  However, it took another 5-7 minutes for it to come out.\n\nThen, she never did a taste check.  She filled someone's water glass with iced tea, took it and the tea pitcher away to fix it, and left 3 of us with empty iced tea glasses till the end of the meal.  She brought one less box then asked for, and it took another 10 minutes to get the extra box.\n\nOf course, since we were a group, the 20% gratuity was included. I don't know if she was new, or just knew she didn't have to worry about the tip, but I was far under impressed.\n\nHowever, the excellent food, rocking tunes and cool decor will be enough to get me back in the door again to give it a second chance.", "date": "2010-03-15 06:29:30"}

It's also behind the Esso gas station in Lake Chapparel.\nThe location itself I believe is a converted pub/sports bar which closed. It's obvious by looking at all the existing televisions in the establishment not reminiscent to a Japanese sushi/restaurant.\nMy family and I were pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive most things on the menu were. I find when things appear inexpensive, you tend to order more and as a result find the bill a little on the expensive side. (For lunch that is).\nWe started with a shared appetizer of ginger beef. Not very Japanese, but tasty none the less. We also ordered the beef yakisoba, mango roll, yam tempura, beef yakitori, a bowl of rice, and also a California roll and 4 pieces of Tamago sushi. All of this with green tea for four people came to around $53.00 including tip.\nThe girl that was waiting on us was very nice, and also good with our children. I know people who have kids, like when wait staff are especially attentive to your kids.\nThis lunch time was not at all busy. Only one other table was being occupied when we arrived. There was one othe table, a party of 4 that was seated prior to our departure.\nThey must have been regulars, as the waitress asked where the dad was who showed up a couple minutes later.\n\nI like this place and will definitley come back.

About 7 months later I had an experience with them again and realized my initial suspicions about them were correct. \n\nLast year I was diagnosed with cancer in my neck & the surgeon who did my biopsy referred me to this place kind of out of nowhere. I had gone to see him on a Thursday for a follow-up (for what was most likely going to be the last time for awhile) & that Monday I was set to start chemotherapy. He thought it was a good idea to see an ENT thinking maybe they could add something to my diagnosis and/or treatment. I thought it was odd to do this so last minute (If I wasn't able to see the ENT the next day...which I was, I even asked my surgeon if he thought I should delay chemo until after I saw the ENT, but he didn't think that was necessary). He was pretty insistent that I go to THIS ENT office. My dad had just got done seeing an ENT for a throat condition, which he (and I) really liked, but my surgeon said he \"never heard of him\" and REALLY wanted me to go to this office (I looked up info on then ENT my dad saw and he has a very good reputation).\n\nI saw Dr. Bailey the following morning. Honestly, I thought he was a good doctor based on the initial exam I had with him. He was thorough & very personable. Since my appointment was scheduled so quickly he didn't have a whole lot of information going in and said he would consult my surgeon and get back to me. I never heard from his office again, but honestly, I didn't think much of it. I was starting chemo and was focused on that. Unless one of my doctors felt it was absolutely necessary to have an ENT involved with my treatment I was fine with never dealing with this office again (not because of Dr. Bailey, like I said, he seemed good) but I already had enough going on with chemo & eventually radiation. \n\nThat being said, I thought the manner in which I was scheduled to come into this office in the first place (and then never hearing from them again) was kind of tacky & it came across like they were just looking for any reason out there to bring in patients (I also understand that my surgeon also shares some responsibility here).\n\nWell, with chemo & radiation complete I recently had a follow-up with my oncologist and he asked about all the doctors I had seen throughout this whole ordeal. He brought up Dr. Bailey (along with my other doctors), and at first I couldn't even remember who that was since I had only seen him the one time. When I said I only saw him once and that was before I started chemo, my oncologist said since technically I DID see him the one time during this whole process he would fax him my latest report (along with all my other doctors). \n\nYesterday I get a phone call from Entegrity saying my oncologist wanted me to come into their office for a follow-up. I thought this was odd since he never mentioned this to me at my last visit (or called me afterwards to tell me this) so I told them I wanted to contact my oncologist's office before scheduling anything (and find out WHY he would want me to schedule something with an ENT). It turns out that he simply faxed them my report (like he said he was going to do), but never mentioned anything about coming back to them for a follow-up. My oncologist's assistant also seemed confused as to why this office wanted me to come back in after 7 months. If the ENT thought there was a reason to come back in based on my oncologist's report that's one thing, but to say my oncologist asked them to schedule me when he didn't is tacky.\n\nAll this just confirmed my initial thoughts that this office comes across desperate for patients. Like I said, I thought Dr. Bailey was good based on my brief encounter with him (which is why I'm willing to give this place a 2nd star). However, I would never come back here...", "date": "2014-05-29 20:03:48"}

Here's my experience ... my wife lost her father and brother a year ago ... their voicemails and pictures were all on my wife's cell phone. We told the repair technician what was happening, and the concern with the data we really needed that was on her IPhone 6. The technician ran a quick test on it and said \"I'm sorry to say it's not the battery, the motherboard is fried and there's nothing that can be done.\" She proceeded to say she could help us get the phone to a data recovery company in California that Apple partners with, but the cost would range from $500-$1,000 for the data recovery. Ultimately, she said the only option with walking out of the store with a working phone is to purchase a new IPhone 8, which we did for $800.00. The girl who sold us the phone was very friendly, and none of this was her fault. Just to take a chance ... I took the old IPhone to a cell phone repair shop in Chandler. Immediately, upon looking at the phone the person said it's the battery. He never hooked it up or anything, but immediately stated the battery was no good, but I was apprehensive to believe him based on what Apple told me. He said \"I'll test a new battery in it and if it doesn't work, there will be no charge.\" He was testing it for free. The girl at Apple said they could try a new battery, but she was 100% sure it wasn't the battery and we would be charged the new battery price of $100.00 whether it worked or not. And we would basically be throwing $100 away. Well low and behold the new battery fired the phone right up. I was in and out of the cell phone repair shop in less than 10 minutes and the cost was $60. It's two months later and the phone still works like new. Needless to say I took the new phone back to Apple for the refund. Apple is there for one thing and that's to sell new phones .. they have no care to fix your phone if they can sell you a new phone. I decided to give 2 stars because the manager was very friendly when we returned the phone, and the sales girl was nice. I believe this just comes down to Apple technicians being pressured to tell customer their old phones can't be repaired so they can get you for $800-$1000 on a new phone .. it's disappointing.", "date": "2017-10-28 19:50:11"}

Over all this place sucks in my humble opinion. I came here for one thing - seafood! I ended up eating more as I will write about. \n\nThe crab is served all cold. They slice everything in half the long way. To be honest I miss the stone age feeling of ripping the limbs apart and hearing that perfect snap and having the joy of a perfect piece of crab coming out in one piece. Do you know how that perfect crab tastes? You know the natural salty sweetness I am talking about!! The same with those perfect shrimps! Well you won't find them here!!! Oh the horror of it! The crabs were so salty that I even went as far as opening up my Netflix app on my iPhone and was going to cancel taping anymore Deadliest Catch episodes! This seams to be done on purpose. I have NEVER had crab that salty before. Not even at those cheap Chinese restaurants that want you to stop eating were that salty!! What about the shrimp you ask?? Well you should have forgotten about that! It was quite the opposite! No taste at all! Why bother getting cholesterol when there is no taste?!?!?!?\n\nSo now out of desperation I decided to try other food. At first glance this place truly has nice food sex appeal. You food lovers know what I mean! When I decided to delve a little more into what there was and how it tasted - ugh! \n\nThey have chicken soup here. If your mama made soup like that - well my advice would be to get a new mama! Next was deep fried chicken which was battered with Matzo of all things. It was not too bad. Then again even Old Country Buffet can make a half way decent piece of deep fried chicken. The seaweed salad was a little on the sweet side but ok. The vegetable rolls were sort of crunchy, oily mush - yuck!!!\n\nSomeone wrote nice things about the Black Angus Burger?? Really?? REALLY?? R E A L L Y!!??!!?? You need to come to Buffalo and I can send you to a nice pub that would rock your world if that is how you think! That poor cow died for this! I am guessing it may of had Alzheimers and Mad Cow disease and did not even know it was cattle in the first place.  In case there is a lawyer reading this I AM JOKING! Jeez! \n\nI just spent $43.23 (w/tax) and am starving! So I went to the salad bar to have Caesar Salad - at least that is what they call it on the name tag. I think I wrote enough for now. Just go somewhere else and spend the money. Either that or put it all on #24 and wish for the best!!!", "date": "2015-09-16 00:23:52"}

It was also greasy.\n\nAs for the supreme, the first thing that I noticed was that the mushrooms they used were canned mushrooms.  I mean, seriously, Why?  Fresh mushrooms are easy to get all year round, so why get them canned?   Later on, I saw their available toppings list and they have both canned AND fresh mushrooms.  I mean, seriously, AGAIN?!  Why give the option?  Just put fresh mushrooms whenever mushrooms are requested (OK, one last time: mushrooms).  Moving on... the supreme was a little better than OK.

This was by far the worst food and service I ever experienced.  Five of use visited Du Par's at the Suncoast Casino.\n\nFirst, service very bad.  We ordered bar drinks and after 15 minutes asked what the problem was.  Response was \"they are on the way\".  After another ten minutes we asked staff to check in the drinks and waited about 10 more minutes before he brought them.  Oh, the place was not busy.  \n\nSecond, the table setting was with the cheapest paper napkins made.  And, when drinks finely arrived they were simply put on the hard table which let wet water from the glasses run on the table.  No coasters.  We had to ask for extra for soak up the water and no help offered.\n\nThird,  the food was worst then the service.  Only one person would rate a 2 star and the rest a 1 (only because you can't leave the rating blank.  We were not asked if we wanted a salad with the meal.  Anyway, I had halibut that was very dry but I ate it because I was hungry.  My baked potato was probably the best food four of us had.  I usually like the potato skin but it was so incrusted in salt I couldn't eat one piece.  Speaking of salt, all the food was very salty.  Also, I like pepper on my potato (I never salt anything) but the shaker was encrusted with dried pepper and whatever I had to retrieve shakers from other tables.  My wife and two others had salmon which was tasteless and drenched in some sort of sauce.  The menu should have stated \"served with ??? sauce\".  With the salmon was mashed potatoes with a horrible gravy.  The gravy had looked like jell on top of a canned ham.  It was also very salty.  The veggies were way over cooked and simply dumped on the plate.  Back to my potato.  I came with sour cream and three foil wrapped butter patties.  The sour cream was in a small plastic cup which was okay.  The butter patties was laying alongside my hot potato.  By the time it reached the table the butter was beyond soft.  One hell of a job unwrapping liquid butter and getting it on the potato.  Even McDonalds serves butter in small cups like the sour cream.\n\nThe bottom line is worst eating experience ever in Vegas.  I can't believe the Suncoast would have such a poor quality restaurant.   Maybe a good manager would help. If I can't get a okay meal at a casino I simply will not visit casino.", "date": "2016-08-03 02:48:29"}

I've been all \"I want to go to there\" for a few months now in anticipation of my partner-in-crime's birthday and we finally made it this past weekend.  \n\nFood: We had the hot crab dip to start and it was completely delicious, creamy, lemony, and the crab still took centre stage.\n\nI got the salmon special, which featured (memory's a little fuzzy here so I apologize) a root vegetable puree and a deep-fried crumble of breadcrumbs, capers, and some other deliciousness I've sadly forgotten.  The salmon was prepared I think with a brine or something like it and was soft and melted down in my mouth like seafood cotton candy. \n\nThe boyfraand got the scallops, which I'd definitely order next time because they were outstanding.  \n\nThe restaurant is dimly lit; a simple decor with modern furniture and cute east-coast details, like stacked cans of evaporated milk.  The service was attentive and knowledgeable.  \n\nOverall, this was a memorably delicious dinner.  \n\nThere have been a few comments about portion sizes, and I must say I disagree. Both my boyfriend and I (average sized humans with very healthy appetites) left stuffed after an appetizer and our entrees.", "date": "2012-03-19 15:42:11"}

The restaurant was completely empty other than those working there and one guy who came in to pick up take-out as we were on our way out.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is underwhelming and actually makes the overall experience a bit unappetizing as does the fact that there are bowls of crispy wonton strips and uncovered containers of duck sauce and hot mustard out on every every table which made me question how fresh and sanitary that is.  My friend ordered green beans with brown sauce which was tasty but she ordered it medium spicy and it had no kick to it whatsoever.  I ordered vegetable pad thai but asked if I could also add tofu and the server said yes.  I also ordered it medium spicy.  My dish was bland and the noodles were undercooked.  The only \"vegetables\" in it were some shredded carrots and a small handful of what appeared to be canned mushrooms, which I picked out.  Overall the experience was just okay.  I would return if I was in the neighborhood and someone suggested it but will not make a special trip to eat there again.  My rating is actually more like 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous.", "date": "2014-09-23 15:06:42"}
